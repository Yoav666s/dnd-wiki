description: |
  You cast a harmless, illusory aspect of another non-illusion spell that you have seen before and is no larger than a 5-foot cube, such as [[Fire Bolt]] or [[Mage Hand]]. The effect fades after a few seconds.

  You may cast this spell during combat in an attempt to confuse or distract a target, which must succeed an Intelligence saving throw in order to tell that it's only an illusion. On failure, the target loses concentration and must use its reaction to evade it.
