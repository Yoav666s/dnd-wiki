  Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

  The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.
