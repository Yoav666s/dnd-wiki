# Amulet of the Sentinel

When the [sentinel](../lore/elmersodus.md#elmersodus-the-weathered-sentinel) is defeated, his soul becomes contained in an amulet. You may use this amulet as an arcane focus or a holy symbol. While you wear this amulet:

- You can expend 1 charge to cast the **gust of wind** spell as an action.
- You can expend 3 charges to cast the **control winds** spell as an action.
- You can expend 5 charges to cast the **investiture of wind** spell as an action.
- You can expend 7 charges to cast the **whirlwind spell** as an action.
- You can expend 10 charges to cast the **storm of vengeance** spell as an action.

The amulet has 10 charges, and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you regain more charges than were previously left expended, roll a d20. On 3 or less, the amulet disappears and Elmersodus is resurrected in his lair.
