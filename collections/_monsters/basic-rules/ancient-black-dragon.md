traits: |
  **Amphibious.** The dragon can breathe air and water.
    
    **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
actions: |
  **Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
    
    **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:+ 15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.
    
    **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.
    
    **Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
    
    **Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
    
    **Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales acid in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 67 (15d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
legendary_actions: |
  **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
    
    **Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.
    
    **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
