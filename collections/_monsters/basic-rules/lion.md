  **Keen Smell.** The lion has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

  **Pack Tactics.** The lion has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the lion's allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

  **Pounce.** If the lion moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the lion can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

  **Running Leap.** With a 10-foot running start, the lion can long jump up to 25 ft..
