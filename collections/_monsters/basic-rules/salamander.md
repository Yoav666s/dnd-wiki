  **Heated Body.** A creature that touches the salamander or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 ft. of it takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.

  **Heated Weapons.** Any metal melee weapon the salamander wields deals an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage on a hit (included in the attack).

  **Multiattack.** The salamander makes two attacks: one with its spear and one with its tail.
  
  **Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20 ft./60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the salamander can automatically hit the target with its tail, and the salamander can't make tail attacks against other targets.
