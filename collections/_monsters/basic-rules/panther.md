  **Keen Smell.** The panther has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

  **Pounce.** If the panther moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the panther can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
