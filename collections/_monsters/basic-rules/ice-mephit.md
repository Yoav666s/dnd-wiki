  **Death Burst.** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of jagged ice. Each creature within 5 ft. of it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

  **False Appearance.** While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary shard of ice.

  **Innate Spellcasting.** The mephit can innately cast fog cloud, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.
actions: |
