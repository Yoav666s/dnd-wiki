traits: |
  **Fey Mind.** Jasper has advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the Charm condition, and magic can't put him to sleep.

  **Heightened Spell (1/day).** When a spell cast by Jasper forces a target to make a saving throw to resist its effects, he may cause one target to have disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

  **Subtle Spell (3/day).** When Jasper casts a spell, he may cast it without any verbal or somatic components.

  **Tome of Delirium.** Whenever a creature succeeds on an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw against one of his spells, Jasper takes 1d4 psychic damage.
bonus_actions: |
  **Artful Magic.** Immediately before or after Jasper casts a spell of 1st level or higher, he can use his bonus action to teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.
actions: |
  **Dagger.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage.

  **Spellcasting.** Jasper casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks):

  At will: fire bolt, fling, mage hand, message, prestidigitation

  2/day each: momentary madness, voices

  1/day each: counterspell, delusion, detect thoughts, intrude thoughts, mage armor, notion, searing pain

  Silvery tears slowly come down from Jasper's eyes whenever he casts a spell.
