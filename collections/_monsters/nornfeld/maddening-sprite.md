  **Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

  **Momentary Madness.** One humanoid the sprite can see within 60 feet must succeed a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw to or be charmed for 1 round. The charmed target uses its action to make a melee attack against a different target that the sprite mentally chooses. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or after the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this spriteâ€™s Momentary Madness for the next 24 hours.

  **Invisibility.** The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.
