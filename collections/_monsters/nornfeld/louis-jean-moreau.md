traits: |
  **Unarmored Defence.** While Moreau is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

  **Shadow Stride.** As a bonus action, while in dim light or darkness, Moreau can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is also in dim light or darkness. He then has advantage on the first melee attack he makes before the end of the turn.

actions: |
  **Multiattack.** The shadow monk can make either three unarmed strikes or three kunai attacks.

  **Kunai.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

  **Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
reactions: |
  **Deflect Missile.** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, the shadow monk can deflect the missile. The damage he takes from the attack is reduced by 10 (1d10 + 5). If the damage is reduced to 0, the shadow Monk catches the missile if itâ€™s small enough to hold in one hand and he has a hand free.
