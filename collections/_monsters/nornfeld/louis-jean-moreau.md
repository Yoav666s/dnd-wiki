traits: |
  **Fey Ancestry.** Moreau has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put him to sleep.

  **Innate Spellcasting.** Moreau’s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 11). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

  At will: dancing lights

  1/day each: darkness, silence

  **Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, Moreau has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

  **Unarmored Defense.** While Moreau is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, his AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

  **Evasion.** When Moreau is subject to an effect that requires him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage, he instead takes no damage on success and half damage on failure.

  **Stunning Strike (Recharge 4-6).** When Moreau hits a creature with an unarmed strike, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of his next turn.
bonus_actions: |
  **Step of the Wind (Recharge 4-6).** Moreau takes the Dash or Disengage action.

  **Patient Defense (Recharge 4-6).** Moreau takes the Dodge action.

  **Shadow Stride.** As a bonus action, while in dim light or darkness, Moreau can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see that is also in dim light or darkness.

  **Shroud of Shadows.** While in dim light or darkness, Moreau becomes invisible. He remains invisible until he makes an attack, casts a spell, or is in an area of bright light.
actions: |
  **Multiattack.** Moreau can make either four unarmed strikes or four kunai attacks.

  **Kunai.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

  **Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
reactions: |
  **Deflect Missile.** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, Moreau can deflect the missile. The damage he takes from the attack is reduced by 10 (1d10 + 5). If the damage is reduced to 0, Moreau catches the missile if it’s small enough to hold in one hand and he has a hand free. He can then make a ranged attack (20/60 ft., with proficiency) using the weapon or piece of ammunition he just caught, as part of the same reaction.
