traits: |
  **Fey Ancestry.** Moreau has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put him to sleep.

  **Innate Spellcasting.** Moreau’s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 11). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

  At will: dancing lights

  1/day each: darkness, silence

  **Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, Moreau has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

  **Unarmored Defence.** While Moreau is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

  **Shadow Stride.** As a bonus action, while in dim light or darkness, Moreau can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see that is also in dim light or darkness. He then has advantage on the first melee attack he makes before the end of the turn.
actions: |
  **Multiattack.** The shadow monk can make either three unarmed strikes or three kunai attacks.

  **Kunai.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

  **Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
reactions: |
  **Deflect Missile.** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, Moreau can deflect the missile. The damage he takes from the attack is reduced by 10 (1d10 + 5). If the damage is reduced to 0, the shadow Monk catches the missile if it’s small enough to hold in one hand and he has a hand free.
legendary_actions: |
  **Shroud of Shadows.** While in dim light or darkness, Moreau becomes invisible and moves up to half his movement speed. He remains invisible until he makes an attack, casts a spell, or is in an area of bright light.

  **Patient Defence.** Moreau takes the Dodge action.

  **Stunning Strike.** Moreau makes one unarmed strike against a creature. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of his next turn.
