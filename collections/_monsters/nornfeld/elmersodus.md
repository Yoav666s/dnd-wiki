traits: |
  **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
actions: |
  **Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
  
  **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage.
  
  **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage.
  
  **Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.
  
  **Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
  
  **Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).** The sentinel blows a strong gust of wind in a line 90 feet long and 10 feet wide, which lasts up to 1 round or until he takes another action. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 65 (10d12) bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed a Strength saving throw or be pushed back 30 feet and knocked prone.

  Any creature in the line must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to the sentinel. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes any flames, unprotected and protected, in the area.
  
  **Change Shape.** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.  
legendary_actions: |
  **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
  
  **Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.
  
  **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
