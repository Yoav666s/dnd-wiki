Centuries ago, the elven general [Urmius Caroletta](/notable-figures/urmius-caroletta/) has led a relentless campaign, eventually conquering every country on [Durn](/lore/durn/) and establishing the [Sad'aaly empire](/lore/the-empire#the-sadaaly-empire). The empire has managed to maintain the peace for over 500 years, suppressing any opposition to the empire and artfully diffusing rebellions before they manage to take hold. Thus, historians have named this campaign "The Last War", as there is no reason or possibility for another war to follow.
