Urk'mor, also known as the great marsh, is a country located in the center of Durn. It's home to many dragonborns, halflings, and drow elves. This is the only country in Durn which is not under direct control of [[the empire]].

During the [[last war]], the Morians were the most cunning adversary of the empire. Their powerful defense paired with numerous offensive operations slowed the empire down in their campaign, leading the empire to resort to offering them a peace treaty. Both sides reached an agreement: Urk'mor won't prevent the empire from continuing eastwards, and the empire will let them keep their independence.
