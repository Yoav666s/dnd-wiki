A maiden of the grove, more commonly referred to as an Eva, is a tree spirit. Originating from Sylvania Woods, Evas are scarcely found in remote forests, far away from civilization. They are said to be unfathomably beautiful; their skin green and ripe, the intoxicating verdant scent of their hair, the color of their eyes ranges from hazel autumn leaves to vibrant flowery blossom.
