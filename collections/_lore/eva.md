> [poem]

A maiden of the grove, more commonly referred to as an Eva, is a tree spirit. Originating from Sylvania Woods, Evas are scarcely found in remote forests, far away from civilization. They are said to be unfathomably beautiful; their skin smooth as silk, green and ripe, the intoxicating verdant scent of their hair, the twinkle of their eyes ranging from hazel shades of autumn leaves to vibrant flowery blossom.

Every Eva belongs to a tree, which is her source of life. Her appearance and personality reflect those of her tree, and she spends most of her life dormant inside it. Men who wander through the forests sometimes encounter an Eva after she wakes from this state, restless and craving intimacy after all the time she spent alone. When she is finally satisfied, she returns to her tree for it must blossom, and after eleven years she wakes again, continuing the cycle.
