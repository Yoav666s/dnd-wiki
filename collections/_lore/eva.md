A maiden of the grove, more commonly referred to as an Eva, is a tree spirit. Originating from Sylvania Woods, Evas are scarcely found in remote forests, far away from civilization. They are said to be unfathomably beautiful; their skin smooth, green and ripe, the intoxicating verdant scent of their hair, the hypnotizing color of their eyes ranging from hazel shades of autumn leaves to vibrant flowery blossom.

Every Eva belongs to a tree, which is her source of life. Her appearance and personality reflect those of her tree, and she spends most of her life dormant inside it. Men who wander through the forests sometimes encounter an Eva after she wakes from this state, restless and seeking intimacy after all the time she spent alone. When she is finally satisfied, she returns to her tree for it must blossom, and after eleven years she wakes again, continuing the cycle.

# The Tale of Delisianna
This is a cautionary tale about evas. Delisianna was a maiden of the grove, as beautiful as they come. She met a man called Taliran, a human, and they fell in love. They both knew that they couldn't make love, for if they did, Delisianna would become dormant. They abstained for ten years, living together in his hut in the woods, not far from her tree. They were happy together, and all was well.

One day, Delisianna sat alone near her tree when a handsome young elf wandered by. He was charming and Delisianna, in her deprived state, let things escalate. Taliran found her dormant in her tree, and he understood what had happened. Eleven years later, when Delisianna emerged from her tree, young and beautiful as ever, Taliran was nowhere to be found. Perhaps he died, or started a family, but Delisianna believed he'd come back for her. Heartbroken and full of regret, she stayed by her tree, hoping that one day he'd find her. She never laid with another man after that, but she never saw Taliran again.
