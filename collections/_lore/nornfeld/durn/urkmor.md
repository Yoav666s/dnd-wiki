Urk'mor, also known as the great marsh, is a country located in the center of [[Durn]]. It's home to many dragonborns, halflings, and drow elves. This is the only country in Durn which is not under direct control of [[the empire]].

During the [[last war]], the Morians were the most cunning adversary of the empire. Their powerful defense paired with numerous offensive operations led by the [[Eyes of Dusk]] slowed the empire down in their campaign, leading the empire to resort to offering them a peace treaty. Both sides reached an agreement: Urk'mor won't prevent the empire from continuing eastwards, and the empire will let them keep their independence.

# Morian Factions
