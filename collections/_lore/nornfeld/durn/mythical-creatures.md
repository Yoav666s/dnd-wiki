The lands of [[Nornfeld]] are full of mythical creatures that reside in certain areas. Their eternal souls are their source of life, but they can be defeated. When a mythical creature is defeated, it leaves behind an emblem that encapsulates its soul until it is risen again. It's possible to use these [[mythical emblems]] as a source of magic, relating to the creature's powers and abilities. This keeps the creature at bay, preventing it from returning to its true form. That also means that if the emblem is not in steady use, the creature might rise again.
