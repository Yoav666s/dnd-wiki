Thortmere is a cold country in the north of [[Durn]], mostly inhabited by humans, halflings, dwarves, and half-orcs. It sees a lot of rain, even in the summer, and a lot of snow in the winter. Its ruler, Krad Genevis the II, is a ruthless king known as Krad the Cruel. He lives in Sun Rock Castle in Corodill, the capital of Thortmere.

# Sun Rock Castle
Built on the Trest mountain range in the east side of Corodill, Sun Rock Castle is named this way because the Trest mountains block the sunrise, which can be seen from the castle.
