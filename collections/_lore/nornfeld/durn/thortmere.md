Thortmere is a cold country in the north of [[Durn]], mostly inhabited by humans, halflings, dwarves, and half-orcs. It sees a lot of rain, even in the summer, and a lot of snow in the winter. Its ruler, Krad Genevis the II, is a ruthless king known as Krad the Cruel. He lives in Sun Rock Castle in Corodill, the capital of Thortmere. Magic is rare in this country, it's a symbol of status. Only the rich have access to books, tomes and other materials related to magic, and clerics, sorcerers and druids usually belong to noble families. There are exceptions, but this is uncommon.

# Sun Rock Castle
Built on the Trest mountain range in the east side of Corodill, Sun Rock Castle is named this way because the Trest mountains block the sunrise, which can be seen from the castle.
