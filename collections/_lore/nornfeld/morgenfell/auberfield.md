Auberfield is governed by the Senate of Auberfield. It is a beautiful country with lots of forests full of fey creatures. The citizens of Auberfield, however, do not approve of the fey as they reek of magic. This is the source of much tension between cities and their surrounding woodlands. This is where most elves choose to reside.
