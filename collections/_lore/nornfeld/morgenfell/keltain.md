Keltain is a kingdom in [[Nornfeld]], governed by king Theodore Roster the IV. It is a bleak place with dangerous forests where all kinds of fearsome monsters prey on the weak. There are vampires, werewolves, and eldritch horrors lurking about, and without magic, there's very little to do about it.

King Roster doesn't bother addressing this problem, since his palace is well guarded, and so are most cities. Monsters rarely attack the cities. The villages, however, aren't so safe. Werewolves lurk in the crop fields and vampires feed at night, while eldritch horrors attack under the grey sky of Keltain.
