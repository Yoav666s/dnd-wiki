Morgenfell is a large continent in [[Nornfeld]], where magic is outside of the law. It is inhabited mostly by humans, but halflings, gnomes, and dwarves live amongst them, and half-orcs can be found there as well.

# The Three Kingdoms
The Three Kingdoms are currently in peaceful, prosperous times. They thrive on trade with other continents that don't have their advanced technology.

## Auberfield
[[Auberfield]] is governed by the Senate of Auberfield.

## Kelterain
[[Kelterain]] is governed by king Theodore Roster the IV. It is a bleak place with dangerous forests where all kinds of fearsome monsters prey on the weak. There are vampires, werewolves, and eldritch horrors lurking about, and without magic, there's nothing to do about it.

## Wedland
[[Wedland]] is governed by queen Juliette Phillips the II.

# The Arcane Dictum
> By order of the sovereign rulers of the Three Kingdoms, and under the authority of the Arcane Dictum, the practice of magic in any and all of its forms is hereby declared strictly and absolutely forbidden. The possession, trade, or use of magical artifacts, spell scrolls, tomes, or any other enchanted instruments is likewise prohibited throughout all territories and dominions of Morgenfell, whether by land or sea.

> --The Arcane Dictum, 217 (A.GM)

For generations and generations, the citizens of Morgenfell have been indoctrinated from youth to despise magic. It's a source of endless trouble and terrible, untimely deaths.

# The Great Massacre
Since the great massacre, the counting of years in Morgenfell is marked with A.GM (after the great massacre).

# Industrial Efforts 
Without magic to rely on, the people of Morgenfell have managed to create magnificent railroad systems, steam engines, factories, and a telecommunication network. In addition, they have firearms and advanced medical education.
