There is a peculiar type of barbarian tribes that reside outside of city limits. Known as "The Hounds," they harass farmers, extorting them for goods. They're also commonly referred to as Pigs by city officials, as a derogatory term. Although they're mostly humans and humanoids, they speak a crude, rudimentary mix of Abyssal and common, and most of them can't read and write.

The Hounds are known for removing their own noses, which results in their resemblance of demons. This is also the source of numerous nicknames, such as Pigs, Imps, and so on.
