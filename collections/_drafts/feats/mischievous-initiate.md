You're well practiced in a mischievous apprentice's trickery:
- You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [[rules:!mischievous apprentice spell list]]. Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for them.
- You become specialized in one cantrip. It gains benefits as described in the [[classes:!mischievous incantations@mischievous-apprentice#mischievous-incantations]] feature, and you can cast it as a bonus action.
- You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks when attempting to cast these cantrip without being noticed.
