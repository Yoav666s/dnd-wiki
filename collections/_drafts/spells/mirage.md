description: |
  Until the start of your next turn, you become [[invisible]] at the same time that an illusory double appears instead of you.

  The spell ends early if you touch another creature, perform an attack, make an audible sound, or if someone tries to interact with your illusion. You automatically fail Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration when this spell is interrupted.

  You may match your pose to your illusory double before the spell ends, making it seem like you were there all along. This way, you can make your dagger appear to teleport from your belt and into your hand, pocket a coin while seeming to sit still, etc. Otherwise, it will seem as if you've teleported to your current position.
