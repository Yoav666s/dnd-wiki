description: |
  You create a harmless, illusory aspect of another non-illusion spell you have seen before, which must fit within a 5-foot cube, such as [[Fire Bolt]] or [[Mage Hand]]. The illusion fades after a few seconds.

  You can use this spell during combat to attempt to confuse or distract a target. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be deceived by the illusion. On a failed save, the target loses concentration, if any, and the next attack against it has advantage until the end of its next turn.
