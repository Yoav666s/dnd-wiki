# Hellish Creatures
Triflings are derived from bloodlines of tieflings mixed with halflings, dwarves, and gnomes. They have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle's, and some spiral upward like an antelopes' horns.

They have slim tails, two to three feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their ears are pointed, their canine teeth are sharp, and their eyes are solid colors--black, red, white, silver, or gold--with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.

# Shunned by Society
Heavily resembling imps in their appearance, triflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in the outskirts of human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with less hostility.

Lacking in physical strength, triflings must rely on their cunning guile and quick reflexes to survive. They are commonly mistaken for imps, greeted with suspicion and even hostility. They find it difficult to gain the trust of others, and so they begin to embrace others' prejudice against them, using their devilish appearance for their advantage.

## Met With Hate
*Many people tend to be hostile towards triflings, naturally regarding them as monsters. Therefore, their presence is not always welcome in most cities, and they often must be discreet about their appearance and identity. It's also recommended for them to stay away from main roads and trade routes in order to avoid undesirable encounters.*
