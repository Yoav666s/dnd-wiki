# Squat and Strong
Mauvians have a short, broad build. Their skin is leathery, almost hide-like, and its color ranges from deep indigo to slate grey, matching the flora and fauna on Albaxia. Their hair grows in dark violet or jet black dreadlocks, and their eyes have slit-shaped, feline pupils and amber colored irises. Their ears are large and cupped forward, capable of capturing vibrations in the ground, and they have no visible nose bridge, just wide slit nostrils.

# Albaxian Natives
Mauvians are the dominant species on Albaxia. They can drink the Nectar found on Albaxia because their digestive system has evolved to distill the water from it, excreting the toxic sludge afterwards. They are used to breathing Krypton, and thus their movements have a calm, flowing slowness to them. Their eyes struggle to see shades of blue, but have adapted to distinguish between different shades of orange, purple, red and infrared.

They have a distinct sleep cycle revolving around the extreme temperatures of the Albaxian day cycle. They sleep during the hottest 10-12 hours of the day and the coldest 10-12 hours of the night, staying awake for around 60 hours at a time.

## Terrestrial Distress
If a mauvian found themselves inside a terrestrial atmosphere which lacks Krypton, they would experience restlessness. They would feel jittery, impatient, and a little anxious. Albaxia has a dense atmosphere, and the thin terrestrial air would not offer the resistance they are used to. This would result in clumsiness and motor overshooting. High pitched sounds will be slightly painful to their ears as they are used to low, deep hums. Drinking pure water is safe but unsatisfying for them, as they are used to the sweet viscous Nectar of Albaxia.
