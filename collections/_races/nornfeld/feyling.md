# Feyling Traits
Itâ€™s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

## Age
Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

## Size
Feylings vary widely in height and build, from barely 3 feet to well over 5 feet tall. Your size is Medium or Small.

## Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

## Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.
