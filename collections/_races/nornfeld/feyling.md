# Feyling Traits
It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

## Age
Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

## Size
Feylings vary widely in height and build, from barely 3 feet to well over 5 feet tall. Your size is Medium or Small.

## Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

## Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Fey Ancestry
You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

## Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.
