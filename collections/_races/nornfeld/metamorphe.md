Metamorphes are creatures who can change shape.

# Metamorphe Traits
It’s hard to make generalizations about metamorphes, but your metamorphe character has these traits.

## Ability Score Increase
When determining your character’s ability scores, increase your Dexterity score by 2 and your Charisma score by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

## Age
Metamorphes reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

## Size
Metamorphes vary widely in height and build, from barely 3 feet to well over 5 feet tall. Your size is Medium or Small.

## Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

## Natural Actor
You are proficient in the Deception skill, and you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks when trying to pass yourself off as someone else.

## Shapeshift
You can alter your shape as an action. You decide what you look like, including your height (Medium or Small), weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. Your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance.

## Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and another language of your choice.
