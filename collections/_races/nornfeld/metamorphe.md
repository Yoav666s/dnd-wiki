# Hideous Creatures
Metamorphes are known for their unsettling form. Their skin is tight on their slender bodies, their hair is white and thin.

[:races/metamorphe/alt;header:]

Their skin has a sickly grey-ish purple tone, and their eyes are pitch black. They can change shape, and they prefer to do so around other people, or mirors.

# Blend In
Metamorphes like to blend in with other races in society, hiding their true form under the guise of other humanoids. They're good at passing themselves off as other people, and use that ability to their greatest advantage.

# Metamorphe Traits
It’s hard to make generalizations about metamorphes, but your metamorphe character has these traits.

## Ability Score Increase
When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and another one by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

## Age
Metamorphes reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

## Size
Metamorphes vary widely in height and build, from barely 3 feet to well over 5 feet tall. Your size is Medium or Small.

## Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

## Natural Actor
You are proficient in the Deception skill, and you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks when trying to pass yourself off as someone else.

## Shapeshift
You can alter your shape as an action. You decide what you look like, including your height (Medium or Small), weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. Your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance.

## Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.

# Variant Metamorphe
If your campaign uses the 2024 ruleset, your Dungeon Master might allow this variant trait which replaces the Ability Score Increase trait.

## Variant Metamorphe Traits

### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
