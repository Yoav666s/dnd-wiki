description: |
  You attempt to make another creature paranoid. One creature you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target willbecome paranoid of something you mentally describe. If it takes damage or is targeted by another spell before you finish, this spell ends and the target dismisses what you say.

  For the duration, you can mentally describe an eminent danger that is personally hunting down the target (such as a secret organization or a monster). The target must be able to understand your language for the paranoia to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing this danger, the target is not paranoid. Otherwise, the paranoia takes hold when the spell ends.

  A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target ends the paranoia.
