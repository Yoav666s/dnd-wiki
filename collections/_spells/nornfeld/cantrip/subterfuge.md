description: |
  You create one of the following instantaneous magical effects within range:
  - You create an auditory effect, such as an unintelligible whisper, faint musical notes, or creaky floorboards.
  - You interact with a nearby opening mechanism, causing an unlocked door, window, or container to softly open or close.
  - You create an instantaneous, harmless, physical sensory effect on another creature, such as a tap on the shoulder, warm breathing against the neck, or a light tug on a pocket. This effect is cannot meaningfully hinder a creature's actions.
  - You teleport an item that you're visibly carrying to your hand, or from your hand to a place such as your belt. The item can weigh no more than 5 lbs.
  - You instantaneously light or snuff out a small flame such as that of a candle or a torch.
