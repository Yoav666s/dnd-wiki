description: |
  You teleport to an unoccupied space within range. If you teleport within 5 feet of a creature, you may make a melee attack with the weapon used in the spell's casting.

  This spell allows you to teleport and attack once more when you reach certain levels: twice at 5th level, three times at 11th level, and four times at 17th level. You cannot target the same creature more than once.
