description: |
  Choose a creature you can see within range. You teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. Immediately after you arrive, you make a melee attack with the weapon used in the spell's casting. If there is no unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target, the spell fails.

  This spell allows you to teleport and attack once more when you reach certain levels: twice at 5th level, three times at 11th level, and four times at 17th level. You cannot attack the same creature more than once in a row. The spell ends if there are no valid targets.
