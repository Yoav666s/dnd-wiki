description: |
  You attempt to delude another creature. One creature you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target will entertain the possibility of one notion you suggest. If it takes damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends and the target dismisses what you say.

  For the duration, you can describe a simple notion that is personally related to the target. It has to be realistically plausible. You must speak to the target and it must be able to understand your language for the notion to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing this notion, the target is not deluded. Otherwise, the delusion takes hold when the spell ends.

  The delusion has to be personally related to the target--someone is attempting to poison it, its friend is secretly planning to sabotage it, its partner is being unfaithful, etc. The delusion doesn't necessarily affect how the target behaves, but it's fiercely convinced of that it's true.

  When presented with contrary evidence, the target repeats its saving throw. On success, the delusion ends. A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target also ends the delusion. Although, the target may not necessarily remember the source of it.
