description: |
  You suggest a realistically plausible notion to a creature that can hear and understand you within range. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On failure, it's fiercely convinced of that notion for the duration, and will refuse to even consider the possibility that it's false. The spell ends early if you cast it again.

  The delusion has to be personally related to the target--someone is attempting to poison it, someone is secretly jealous and planning to sabotage it, its partner is unfaithful, etc. Depending on the target's personality and the nature of the delusion, it may go to great extents to escalate the situation. The target rationalizes any inconsistencies between the delusion and reality, favoring the delusion.

  Another creature may attempt to convince the target that it's being delusional, making a Charisma ([[Persuasion]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target realizes that it's a delusion and the spell ends.
