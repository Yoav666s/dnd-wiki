description: |
  You unleash a focused burst of wind in a direction you choose. The wind travels in a line 5 feet wide and 30 feet long. The first creature in the line must make a Strength saving throw. On failure, it takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.

  The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
