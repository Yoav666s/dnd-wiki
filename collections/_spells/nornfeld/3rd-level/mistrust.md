description: |
  One creature you choose must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or become hostile towards all creatures it can see or hear for the duration. A creature prone to violence might attack. Another creature might behave in other ways (at the DM's discretion), depending on the nature of other creatures' interactions with it.

  A formerly allied creature to the target can take an action to try and appeal to their emotional connection if they are within 30 feet of each other. If this happens, the target repeats its saving throw. On success, the spell ends.

  **At higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, it lasts until dispelled if you concentrate on it for the full duration. A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target ends the lasting effects of this spell.
