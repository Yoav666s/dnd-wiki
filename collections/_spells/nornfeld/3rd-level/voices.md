description: |
  A creature you choose starts hallucinating voices for the duration. The target must make an Wisdom saving throw. On failure, it hears strange voices telling it what you decide for the duration. The voices seem to originate somewhere from the target's surroundings, but it can never quite find the origin point. If the target is not a player, the DM decides how the voices affect the target and if it listens to them.
  
  **At higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, it lasts until dispelled if you concentrate on it for the full duration. A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target ends the lasting effects of this spell.
