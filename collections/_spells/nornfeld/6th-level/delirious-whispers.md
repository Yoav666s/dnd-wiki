description: |
  One humanoid you choose must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or hear whispers for the duration. The whispers can be either **murderous** or **paranoid**. If the target is not a player, DM decides how the whispers affect it.

  **Murderous.** The target hears whispers that encourage it to kill everyone it can see, friend or foe. For the duration, the target must use its action on each of its turns to take the attack action against the nearest creature it can see.

  **Paranoid.** The target hears whispers that irrationally warn it from danger, whether it be the possibility of a monster lurking around the corner, being betrayed and killed by its friends, etc. For the duration, the target is frightened of every creature it can see.

  A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target ends the effects of this spell.

  **At higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, it lasts until dispelled if you concentrate on it for the full duration.
