  You dominate the thoughts of a creature you choose. If the target has an Intelligence of 3 or lower, it is unaffected. When you cast this spell and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action speak in the target's thoughts if you know a language it understands. You can also use your action force it to imagine what you are imagining, and decide what it wants and how it feels.

  The target is not initially aware of your presence in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw if the content of your thoughts or imagination conflicts with its own, contradicts strongly held beliefs, or is inconsistent with its knowledge. The target also makes the saving throw if what you decide it wants or feels contradicts what it actually wants and feels. If it succeeds, the spell ends. On failure, it believes that your planted thoughts, imagery, desires, and feelings originate from its own mind. If the target is not a player, the DM decides the consequences of this.

  When the spell ends, the target's opinions, desires, and feelings revert to what they originally were unless you concentrated on this spell for the full duration. A greater restoration or heal spell cast on the target will also revert these back to normal.
