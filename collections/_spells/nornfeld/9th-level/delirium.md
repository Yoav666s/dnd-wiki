description: |
  One humanoid you choose must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become delirious for the duration. On failure, the target suffers from poor memory, not knowing where or who they are, trouble with speech or recalling words, rambling nonsense, struggle understanding speech, and inability to read or write. The target rambles nonsens and cannot take its actions to attack.

  If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, it lasts until dispelled. A greater restoration or heal spell cast on the target ends the effects of this spell.
