description: |
  Two creatures you touch switch minds. An unwilling creature can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isnâ€™t affected by this spell. If both creatures are unwilling, they both need to fail their saving throws for the spell to take effect. A construct or undead is unaffected by this spell. The switched creatures' Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are transferred with their mind to their new bodies, and they retain their class features as well (if they have any). Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores remain with the body, as well as racial or innate traits and abilities.

  You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible while both creatures are within 1 mile of each other. Examples include "a true love's kiss" or "when the quest is completed."

  If one creature would die while under the effects of this spell, this spell cannot be dispelled for the other unless it is resurrected.
