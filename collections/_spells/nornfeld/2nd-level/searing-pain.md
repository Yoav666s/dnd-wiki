  One creature you choose must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or feel immense pain. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also has disadvantage the next saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.

  **At higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage dealt by this spell increases by 1d6 for every slot level above 2nd.
