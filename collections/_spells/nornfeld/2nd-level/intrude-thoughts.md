description: |
  You intrude the thoughts of a creature you can see within range. If the target has an Intelligence of 3 or lower, it is unaffected. When you cast this spell and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action speak in the target's thoughts if you know a language it understands. You can also use your action to force it to imagine what you are imagining.

  The target is not initially aware of your presence in its mind, but it becomes aware of it if the content of your thoughts or imagination conflicts with its own, contradicts strongly held beliefs, or is inconsistent with its knowledge. If the target is or becomes unwilling, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell ends.
