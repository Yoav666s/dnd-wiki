description: |
  You control the thoughts of a creature you choose. If the target has an Intelligence of 3 or lower, it is unaffected. When you cast this spell and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action speak in the target's thoughts if you know a language it understands. You can also use your action force it to imagine what you are imagining.

The target is not initially aware of your presence in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw if the content of your thoughts or imagination conflicts with its own, contradicts strongly held beliefs, or is inconsistent with its knowledge. If it succeeds, the spell ends. On failure, it believes that your planted thoughts or imagery originate from its own mind. If the target is not a player, the DM decides the consequences of this.
