description: |
  One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration.

  While charmed in this way, the target's eyes glow a sickly shade of purple. The charmed target must use its action before or after moving to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. If you choose no creature or if none are within its reach, the charmed target acts normally.

  **At higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
