description: |
  You whisper a message of twenty five words or less intended for a creature within range. The target (and only the target) hears the message but doesn't recognize you as the source. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On failure, it believes the message is a spontaneous thought that occurred to it in its mind. If the target is not another player, the DM decides the consequences of the message. If the message is unreasonable, the target will dismiss it.

  You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesnâ€™t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
