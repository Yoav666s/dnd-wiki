description: |
  While standing in a dark or dimly lit area, you blend in with the shadows around you, becoming [invisible](/rules/conditions/#invisible/) for the duration. Anything you're wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on your person. The spell ends if you find yourself in a well-lit area, perform an attack, or cast a spell.
