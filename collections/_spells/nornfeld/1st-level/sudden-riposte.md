description: |
  You unleash a burst of forceful wind against a creature that targets you with a melee attack. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed away.

  **At higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
