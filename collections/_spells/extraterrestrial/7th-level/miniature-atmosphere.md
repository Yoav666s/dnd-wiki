description: |
  An immobile sphere of force springs into existence around you and remains stationary for the duration. The area is a sphere that can be as small as 5 feet in radius to as large as 50 feet in radius.
  
  The atmosphere inside the space is composed of breathable air of a composition you decide, and the composition must be one you know. Creatures, objects, and other effects can pass freely through the edges of the sphere, except for nonmagical gasses.
  
  Different planets have different atmospheres. Each atmosphere is composed of a different combination of gasses. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the atmosphere composition of the planet you are on. You can commit a new atmosphere composition to memory by studying it, either from written notes or by using magical instruments to analyze it.
  
  You can create a permanent miniature atmosphere by casting this spell in the same spot with the same air composition every day for a year. The air inside is being magically refreshed and stays breathable indefinitely.
