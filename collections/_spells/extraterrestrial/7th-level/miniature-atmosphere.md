description: |
  A 50-foot-radius immobile sphere of force springs into existence around you and remains stationary for the duration. The area is a sphere that can be as small as 5 feet in radius to as large as 50 feet in radius. 
  
  The atmosphere inside the space is composed of breathable air, which is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Creatures, objects, and other effects can pass freely through the edges of the sphere, except for nonmagical gasses.
  
  You can create a permanent miniature atmosphere by casting this spell in the same spot every day for a year. Without any form of air purification, assuming there is at least one creature within the sphere, the air becomes unbreathable after a number of days equal to the sphere's radius divided by 5.
