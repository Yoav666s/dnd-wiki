**Cantrip** \
You cast a harmless, illusory aspect of another non-illusion spell that you have seen before, such as Fire Bolt or Mage Hand. The effect fades after no more than a few seconds.

You may cast this spell during combat in an attempt to confuse or distract an enemy. The target must succeed an Intelligence saving throw in order to tell that it's only an illusion. On failure, the target loses concentration and must use its reaction to evade it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the illusion, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

You can target one additional creature when you reach a higher level: two creatures at 5th level, three creatures at 11th level, and four creatures at 17th level. You may target the same creature more than once if it succeeded its saving throw, but it will have advantage on consecutive rolls.
