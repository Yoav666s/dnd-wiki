description: |
  You cast a harmless, illusory aspect of another non-illusion spell that you have seen before, such as Fire Bolt or Mage Hand, and is no larger than a 5-foot cube. The effect fades after a few seconds.

  You may cast this spell during combat in an attempt to confuse or distract an enemy. The target must succeed an Intelligence saving throw in order to tell that it's only an illusion. On failure, the target loses concentration and must use its reaction to evade it.
