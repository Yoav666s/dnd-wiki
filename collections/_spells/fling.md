Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isnâ€™t being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 60 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. You may send it towards one of your free hands and catch it.

If the object would strike a creature, make a ranged weapon attack which originates from the object's position, not yours. On a hit, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 1d8 of bludgeoning damage. Depending on its properties, the object may deal an additional 1d4 of the appropriate damage type. For example:

- A lit torch would burn the target, dealing an additional 1d4 of fire damage.
- A vase would shatter on impact, dealing an additional 1d4 of slashing damage.
- A vial of acid would shatter on impact, dealing an additional 1d4 of acid damage.

This spell flings an object once more when you reach a higher level: two flings at 5th level, three flings at 11th level, and four flings at 17th level. You can direct each fling at the same target or at different ones, and you may fling the same object more than once. If you attempt to strike enemies multiple times, make a separate roll for each attack.
