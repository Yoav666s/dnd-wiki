  You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.

  **At higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
