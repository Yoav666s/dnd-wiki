description: |
  A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

  A non-magical item that is not worn or carried also suffers damage if it is in the area of the spell.

  **At higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a 3 or higher level spell slot, the damage of the spell increases by 1d8 for each level of higher spell slot 2.
