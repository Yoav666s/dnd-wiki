  Thin and vaporous flame surround your body for the duration of the spell, radiating a bright light bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell using an action to make it disappear.

  The flames are around you a heat shield or cold, your choice. The heat shield gives you cold damage resistance and the cold resistance to fire damage.

  In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, flames spring from the shield. The attacker then suffers 2d8 points of fire damage or cold, depending on the model.
