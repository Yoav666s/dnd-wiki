**1st Level** \
You create an illusion of any creature that is no larger than yourself, along with a mindless, shapeless, medium force. Composing together an imaginary friend, this spell has two independent components: The illusory aspect and the physical aspect. It springs into existence in an unoccupied space within range.

- The illusory aspect lasts for 1 minute, or for as long as you maintain concentration. At any point, and as long as the physical aspect is still active, you may resume concentrating on the illusion, making it reappear at the appropriate position.
- The physical aspect has an AC of 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2. If it drops to 0 hit points it disappears along with the illusion, and the spell ends. Otherwise, it lasts for the full duration and doesn't require your concentration.

Once on each of your turns as an bonus action, you can mentally command your friend to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object, moving the illusion along with it and altering its appearance to match (as long as you're maintaining concentration on it). Once you give the command, it performs the task to the best of its ability until completion, then waits for your next command. If you command your friend to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

When you cast a spell, your friend can deliver it as if it had cast the spell, as long as it's within 60 feet of you. This will interrupt anything that it is currently doing and it cannot perform another action until you next turn. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

When both you and your imaginary friend are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

If a creature uses its action to examine the illusion, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.
