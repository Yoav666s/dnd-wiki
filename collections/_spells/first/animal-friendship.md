This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed]() by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.
