*General Feat (Perquisite: level 4+)*

Your connection to the Feywild grants you the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Find Familiar.** You always have the [[Find Familiar]] spell prepared, and you can cast it as a ritual. The familiar must be a fey, and it can take the form of a [[monsters:Sprite]] or a [[monsters:Blink Dog]].

**Cantrip.** You learn a Enchantment or Illusion cantrip of your choice. Its spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

**Subterfuge.** You learn the [[Subterfuge]] cantrip. You can cast [[Subterfuge]] as part of drawing or sheathing a weapon of the light property to teleport it to or from your hand. This doesn't require an action, but it takes as much time as it would normally take to draw or sheath a weapon.
