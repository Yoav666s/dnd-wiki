You’re well practiced in a mischievous apprentice’s trickery:
- You learn one cantrip of your choice from the mischievous apprentice spell list. Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for it.
- You become specialized in this cantrip. It gains an additional benefit from the [mischievous incantations](/classes/rogue/mischievous-apprentice/#mischievous-incantations) feature, and you can cast it as a bonus action.
- You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks when trying to cast this spell without being noticed.
