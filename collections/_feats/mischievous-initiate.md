You're well practiced in a mischievous apprentice's trickery:
- You learn one cantrip of your choice from the mischievous apprentice [[rules:spell list@spell-list/mischievous-apprentice/]]. Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for it.
- You become specialized in this cantrip. It gains benefits as described in the [[classes:mischievous incantations@rogue/mischievous-apprentice/#mischievous-incantations]] feature, and you can cast it as a bonus action.
- You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks when attempting to cast this cantrip without being noticed.
