Choose a [Mischievous Apprentice cantrip](/classes/rogue/mischievous-apprentice/#mischievous-incantations) to specialize in. You learn it if you don't know it already, and it doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. You can cast it as a bonus action and it gains additional benefits you may have from other sources.
