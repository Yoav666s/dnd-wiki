You're well practiced in a mischievous apprentice's trickery:
- You learn two cantrips of your choice from the mischievous apprentice [spell list](/rules/spell-list/mischievous-apprentice/). Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for them.
- You become specialized in one cantrip. It gains benefits as described in the [mischievous incantations](/classes/rogue/mischievous-apprentice/#mischievous-incantations) feature, and you can cast it as a bonus action.
- You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks when attempting to cast these cantrip without being noticed.
