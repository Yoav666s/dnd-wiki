This book contains forbidden knowledge of spells and incantations that mess with the subjects' minds. The contents of this book are written in Sylvan. If you are a spellcaster and spend 24 hours over a period of 6 days of fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, you can attune to it.

While attuned to this book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus, and you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DC of your spells. You also know the following spells and can cast them using any spell slots you have:

| Level | Spells |
| :---: | :----- |
| 1st   | [[!Hideous Laughter]], [[!Momentary Madness]], [[!Notion]] |
| 2nd   | [[!Intrude Thoughts]], [[!Searing Pain]], [[!Suggestion]] |
| 3rd   | [[!Fear]], [[!Mistrust]], [[!Voices]] |
| 4th   | [[!Delusion]], [[!Paranoia]], [[!Phantasmal Killer]] |
| 5th   | [[!Control Thoughts]], [[!Dominate Person]], [[!Modify Memory]] |
| 6th   | [[!Delirious Whispers]], [[!Mass Suggestion]] |
| 7th   | [[!Switch Minds]] |
| 8th   | [[!Dominate Thoughts]] |
| 9th   | [[!Delirium]] |

Whenever a creature successfully succeeds an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw against a spell you cast, make a Wisdom saving throw against your own spell save DC. On failure, you take 1d4 psychic damage and roll a d12 to determine the side effects from the Delirium Table:

| d12 | Side Effect |
| :-: | :---------- |
| 1   | You feel a terrible sharp pain in your head. |
| 2   | You hear unintelligible whispers behind you until you turn around. When you do, you see a monster that disappears the next time you blink. |
| 3   | A sudden scream echoes in your head for a few seconds. |
| 4   | You feel something brushing against your arm, but nothing is there. |
| 5   | You hear a voice whisper your name behind you. |
| 6 | Your skin prickles as if insects are crawling over it. |
| 7 | You feel a cold breath against your neck. |
| 8 | You hear whispers in a language you don't know. |
| 9 | You feel your hair being tugged lightly. |
| 10 | You can't breathe for a few seconds. |
| 11 | You feel a hand resting on your shoulder, but if you turn to look nothing is there. |
| 12 | You hear the ticking of a clock in the back of your head. |

In addition, once you attune to this book:

- You start hearing voices originating from the tome, whispers telling you strange things, warning you of dangers that aren't there, turning you against your allies, telling you that you're meant for great things.
- You start seeing hallucinations, monsters at your peripheral vision, people that disappear at a blink of an eye, insects that turn out to be smudges on the wall.
- You are vulnerable to psychic damage.
