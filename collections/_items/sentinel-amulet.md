The emblem of [[lore:the weathered sentinel]]. When he is defeated, his soul becomes contained in this amulet. You may use this amulet as an arcane focus or a holy symbol. While you wear this amulet while attuned to it:

- You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
- You can cast the [[wind blast]] cantrip without requiring material components.
- You can expend 1 charge to cast the [[fog cloud]] spell.
- You can expend 2 charges to cast the [[gust of wind]] spell.
- You can expend 3 charges to cast the [[wind wall]] spell.
- You can expend 6 charges to cast the [[storm of vengeance]] spell.

The amulet has 6 charges, and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If it overcharges, roll a d20. On 4-7 the charges deplete completely for the rest of the day. On 3 or less, the amulet disappears and Elmersodus is resurrected.
