This enchanted device is capable of analyzing objects and atmospheres using magic. In order to get an output from this device, you need to insert a small piece of parchment into the slot at the bottom. It has two modes.

**Aeris.** The device analyzes the composition of air around it in a 10-foot radius. It takes 1 minute for it to complete this process and inscribe the immediate atmosphere composition on the piece of parchment.

**Magus.** The device analyzes an object for magical properties. You can cast [[Identify]] with it without a spell slot or components. You learn the magical properties (or lack thereof) of the object from the inscription on the piece of parchment.
