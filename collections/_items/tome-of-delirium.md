This book contains forbidden knowledge of spells and incantations that mess with the subjects' minds. If you are a spellcaster and spend 24 hours over a period of 6 days of fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, you can attune to it.

While attuned to this book, you know the following spells and can cast them using any spell slots you have:

| Level | Spells |
| :---: | :----- |
| 1st   | [[Momentary Madness]], [[Notion]] |

Whenever you cast a spell from this book, make a Wisdom saving throw against your own spell save DC. On failure, roll a d20 to determine the side effects from the Delirium Table:
