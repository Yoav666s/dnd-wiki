This book contains forbidden knowledge of spells and incantations that mess with the subjects' minds. If you are a spellcaster and spend 24 hours over a period of 6 days of fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, you can attune to it.

While attuned to this book, you know the following spells and can cast them using any spell slots you have:

| Level | Spells |
| :---: | :----- |
| 1st   | [[!Momentary Madness]], [[!Notion]] |
| 2nd   | [[!Intrude Thoughts]], [[!Searing Pain]] |
| 3rd   | [[!Mistrust]], [[!Voices]] |
| 4th   | [[!Delusion]], [[!Paranoia]] |
| 5th   | [[!Control Thoughts]] |
| 6th   | [[!Delirious Whispers]] |
| 7th   | [[!Switch Minds]] |
| 8th   | [[!Dominate Thoughts]] |
| 9th   | [[!Delirium]] |

Whenever a creature successfully resists a spell from this book, make a Wisdom saving throw against your own spell save DC. On failure, roll a d20 to determine the side effects from the Delirium Table:

| d20 | Side Effect |
| :-: | :---------- |
| 1   | You feel a terrible sharp pain in your head. You take 1d6 psychic damage. |
| 2   | You hear unintelligible whispers behind you until you turn around. When you do, you see a monster that disappears the next time you blink. |
| 3   | A faint laugh echoes in your head for a few seconds. |
| 4   | You feel something brushing against your arm, but nothing is there. |
| 5   | You hear a voice whisper your name behind you. |
| 6 | Your skin prickles as if insects are crawling over it. |
| 7 | You feel a cold breath against your neck. |
| 8 | You hear whispers in a language you don't know. |
| 9 | You feel your hair being tugged lightly. |
| 10 | You can't breathe for a few seconds. |
| 11 | You feel a hand resting on your shoulder, but if you turn to look nothing is there. |
| 12 |  |
