When the [thing's](/lore/the-thing#thing-of-the-hollow) heart is destroyed, his essence becomes stored in this locket. You may use the Locket as an arcane focus. While wearing the Locket:

- You can expend 1 charge to cast the **move earth** spell.
- You can expend 2 charge to cast the **phantasmal force** spell.
- You can expend 3 charges to cast the **dimension door** spell.
- You can expend 4 charges to cast the **hallucinatory terrain** spell.
- You can expend 5 charges to cast the **dream** spell.

The Locket has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If you regain more charges than were previously left expended, roll a d20. On 3 or less, the Locket disappears and the Hollow Heart reappears somewhere in the caverns, resurrecting the Thing.
