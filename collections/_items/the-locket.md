[[lore:The thing's]] emblem. When its heart is destroyed, its essence becomes stored in this locket. You may use the Locket as an arcane focus. While wearing the Locket:

- You can expend 1 charge to cast the [[move earth]] spell.
- You can expend 2 charges to cast the [[dimension door]] spell.
- You can expend 3 charges to cast the [[major image]] spell.
- You can expend 4 charges to cast the [[hallucinatory terrain]] spell.
- You can expend 5 charges to cast the [[dream]] spell.
- You can expend 6 charges to cast the [[magic jar]] spell, using the locket as the container.

The locket has 6 charges, and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If the locket overcharges, roll a d20. On 4-7 the charges deplete completely for the rest of the day. On 3 or less, the Locket disappears and the Hollow Heart reappears somewhere in the caverns, resurrecting the Thing.

If you use the locket with [[magic jar]], it doesn't get destroyed when the spell ends; instead, roll a d20 and follow the same instructions as described above. While your soul inhabits the locket, it does not regain charges and you can cast the other spells listed above *at will*.
