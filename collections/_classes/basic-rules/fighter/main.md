Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Martial Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.
