Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

*You must have a Charisma score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.*
