Monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

*You must have a Dexterity score and a Wisdom score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.*
