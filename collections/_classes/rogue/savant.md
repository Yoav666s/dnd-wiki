You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.


# Intellectual Jargon
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you captivate others with your incisive intellect. When you make [[deception]], [[intimidation]], and [[persuasion]] checks, you may use your Intelligence modifier instead of Charisma.

# Analytical Mind
Starting at 3rd level, your mind is accustomed to literary and arcane writing. You gain proficiency in the [[arcana]] and [[history]] skills if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those proficiencies.

# Arcane Novice
Starting at 3rd level, as part of a long rest, you may make an [[arcana]] check in an attempt to decipher a spell scroll. On success, you know what spell it contains, and you're able to cast this spell using the scroll. Once you decipher a spell scroll this way, you can read and use other scrolls containing the same spell without deciphering them again.

# Scholar and Scribe
Starting at 9th level, you can replicate spell scrolls. As part of a long rest, you may copy the contents of a spell scroll to a dedicated spellbook. You must succeed on an Intelligence ([[Arcana]]) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spellâ€™s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.
