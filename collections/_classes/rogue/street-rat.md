You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.

# Backstreet Jostler
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, another creature's space does not count as [[difficult terrain]] for you. Additionally, when you take the [[dash]] action, you can move through a hostile creature's space regardless of its size, although you still provoke an [[opportunity attack]] as normal if you leave its reach.

# Adaptive Strategies
Starting at 3rd level, when you take the [[ready]] action, you don't need to use your reaction in order to act when the trigger occurs. You may also ready a bonus action instead of taking it immediately.

# Ready for a Row
Starting at 3rd level, you can add your [[proficiency bonus]] to your [[initiative]] rolls. On the first round of combat, if you're the first to act, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make that round.

# Anticipatory Dodge
Starting at 9th level, when you end your turn in combat without making an attack, the next attack against you before the start of your next turn has disadvantage.
