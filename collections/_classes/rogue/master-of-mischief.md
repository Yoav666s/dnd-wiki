# Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Sorcerer spell list.

## Cantrips
You learn three cantrips of your choice from the Master of Mischief spell list.

## Spell Slots
The Master of Mischief Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the sorcerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Master of Mischief Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

## Spellcasting Ability
Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through repeated practice and rely on muscle memory. You use your Dexterity whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Dexterity modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

# Trickery Points
Your hands are nimble and your senses are shrewd. Starting at 3rd level, you gain trickery points. You can spend them to swiftly cast cantrips in unexpected moments.

You trickery point pool is calculated as such: Character level + DEX Modifier

## Concealed Gesture
You can spend a trickery point to give yourself advantage on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check when attempting to cast a spell without being noticed.

## Deft Hands
You can spend two trickery points to cast a cantrip as a bonus action instead of an action. On following turns, you may interact with it as a bonus action until it ends.

# Mischievous Incantations
At 3rd level, you choose two Master of Mischief cantrips to specialize in:
- [Deceitful Maneuver](/spells/deceitful-maneuver/)
- [False Display](/spells/false-display/)
- [Fling](/spells/fling/)
- [Minor Phantasm](/spells/minor-phantasm)
- [Subterfuge](/spells/subterfuge/)

You learn them if you don't know them already, and they do not count against your known cantrips.

# Second Nature
Starting at 9th level, your mischievous incantations become second nature to you, and you can spend a trickery point to cast them effortlessly as a free interaction, if to a lesser effect.

## Deceitful Step
If you're specialized in the [Deceitful Maneuver](/spells/deceitful-maneuver/) cantrip, you learn the Deceitful Step. As your interaction, you can spend a trickery point to cast Deceitful Maneuver. It doesn't require your concentration, but it dispels either at the start of your next turn or after you move 5 feet in any direction.

## Folly Spectacle
If you're specialized in the [False Display](/spells/false-display/) cantrip, you learn the Folly Spectacle. As your free interaction, you can spend a trickery point to cast False Display at an enemy within 5 feet of you.

## Flick
If you're specialized in the [Fling](/spells/fling/) cantrip, you learn Flick. As your free interaction, you can spend a trickery point to Fling one object within 5 feet of you up to 30 feet in a chosen direction. Its damage is reduced to 1d4, but it may still deal an additional 1d4 depending on its properties.

## Micro Phantasm
If you're specialized in the [Minor Phantasm](/spells/minor-phantasm) cantrip, you learn the Micro Phantasm. As your free interaction, you can spend a trickery point to cast Minor Phantasm on an enemy within 5 feet of you. It doesn't require your concentration, but it dispels at the start of your next turn and isn't convincing enough to deal damage.

## Subtle Ruse
If you're specialized in the [Subterfuge](/spells/subterfuge/) cantrip, you learn the Subtle Ruse. As your interaction, you can spend a trickery point to cast Subterfuge at half range.
