# Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Sorcerer spell list.

## Cantrips
You learn three cantrips of your choice from the Master of Mischief spell list.

## Spell Slots
The [Master of Mischief Spellcasting table](#master-of-mischief-spellcasting) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.

## Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the sorcerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Master of Mischief Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

## Spellcasting Ability
Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through repeated practice and rely on muscle memory. You use your Dexterity whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Dexterity modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

# Trickery Points
Your hands are nimble and your senses are shrewd. Starting at 3rd level, you gain trickery points. You can spend them to swiftly cast cantrips in unexpected moments.

You trickery point pool is calculated as such: `Character level + DEX Modifier`

## Deft Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can spend 2 trickery points to cast a cantrip as a bonus action, instead of an action. On following turns and until it ends, you may interact with it as a bonus action instead of an action.

## Concealed Gesture
Starting at 9th level, you can spend 1 trickery point to give yourself advantage on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check when attempting to cast a spell without being noticed.

## Elegant Improvisation
Starting at 13th level, you can spend 5 trickery points in order to take an additional reaction.

## Astute Awareness

# Mischievous Incantations
At 3rd level, you choose two cantrips to specialize in:
- [Deceitful Maneuver](/spells/deceitful-maneuver/)
- [False Display](/spells/false-display/)
- [Fling](/spells/fling/)
- [Minor Phantasm](/spells/minor-phantasm)
- [Subterfuge](/spells/subterfuge/)

You learn them if you don't know them already, and they do not count against your known cantrips. They dictate which abilities you attain at higher levels.

# Second Nature
Starting at 9th level, your mischievous incantations become second nature to you, and you can spend 1 trickery point to cast them effortlessly as a free interaction, if to a lesser effect. If you try to do so without being noticed, you gain advantage on the Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

## Deceitful Step
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Deceitful Maneuver](/spells/deceitful-maneuver/) cantrip, you learn the **Deceitful Step**. As your free interaction, you can spend 1 trickery point to cast Deceitful Maneuver. It doesn't require your concentration, but it dispels either at the start of your next turn or after you move 5 feet in any direction.

## Folly Spectacle
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [False Display](/spells/false-display/) cantrip, you learn the **Folly Spectacle**. As your free interaction, you can spend 1 trickery point to cast False Display targeting a creature within 5 feet of you.

## Flick
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Fling](/spells/fling/) cantrip, you learn **Flick**. As your free interaction, you can spend 1 trickery point to Fling one object within 10 feet of you up to 30 feet in a chosen direction. The damage is reduced to 1d4, but it may still deal an additional 1d4 depending on its properties.

## Milder Phantasm
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Minor Phantasm](/spells/minor-phantasm) cantrip, you learn the **Milder Phantasm**. As your free interaction, you can spend 1 trickery point to cast Minor Phantasm on a creature within 5 feet of you. It doesn't require your concentration, but it ends at the start of your next turn.

## Subtle Cues
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Subterfuge](/spells/subterfuge/) cantrip, you learn **Subtle Cues**. As your interaction, you can spend 1 trickery point to cast Subterfuge and distract one creature within 15 feet of you.

# Artful Instincts
Starting at 13th level, trickery and mischief slowly become an extension of your body. You learn to utilize your mischievous incantations in a repertoire of unique reactions. If you do so through an [Elegant Improvisation](#elegant-improvisation), you don't need to spend additional trickery points.

## Deceitful Dodge
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Deceitful Maneuver](/spells/deceitful-maneuver/) cantrip, you learn the **Deceitful Dodge**. When you're targeted by an attack that relies on sight, you may spend 1 trickery point and use your reaction to cast Deceitful Maneuver in an attempt to dodge, moving out of the way and giving your enemy disadvantage on the attack roll. You may move up to 5 feet if there is a safe, unoccupied area within 5 feet for you to step into and you have enough remaining movement to do so.

## Daunting Display
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [False Display](/spells/false-display/) cantrip, you learn the **Daunting Display**. When a creature attempts to move within 30 feet of you, you may spend 2 trickery points and use your reaction to cast False Display in an attempt to startle it.

The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw in order to tell that it's only an illusion. On failure, it uses its reaction to stop in its tracks and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the round.

## Divert
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Fling](/spells/fling/) cantrip, you learn **Divert**. When you notice a ranged weapon attack, you may spend 3 trickery points and use your reaction to try and divert its projectile when it reaches a distance of 30 feet or less from you.

Subtract `1d10 + your DEX modifier` from the attack roll. If the projectile would then miss the target, you may divert it in a direction you choose within a 30-foot cone of the original direction. If you direct the projectile to hit a different target, it can evade it by succeeding a Dexterity saving throw against the modified attack roll. On a hit, the original attacker rolls for damage.

## Momentary Phantasm
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Minor Phantasm](/spells/minor-phantasm) cantrip, you learn the **Momentary Phantasm**. When a creature makes a melee attack within 30 feet of you, you may spend 2 trickery points and use your reaction to cast Minor Phantasm in an attempt to interrupt it. The phantasm has to directly affect the attack, such as turning the attacker's weapon to molten lava, creating a splash of acid in its face, etc. 

## Sudden Ruse
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Subterfuge](/spells/subterfuge/) cantrip, you learn the **Sudden Ruse**. When an ally makes an attack on an enemy that is within 30 feet of you, you may spend 1 trickery point and use your reaction to cast Subterfuge in an attempt to distract only that enemy, giving your ally advantage on the attack.

# Unimplemented Feature 
Starting at 17th level, this feature is yet to be implemented.
