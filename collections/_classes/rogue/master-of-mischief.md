# Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Sorcerer spell list.

## Cantrips
You learn three cantrips of your choice from the Master of Mischief spell list.

## Spell Slots
The [Master of Mischief Spellcasting table](#master-of-mischief-spellcasting) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.

## Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the sorcerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Master of Mischief Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

## Spellcasting Ability
Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through repeated practice and rely on muscle memory. You use your Dexterity whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Dexterity modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

# Flair Points
You have an eye for flair. Starting at 3rd level, you gain flair points, which can spend to swiftly cast cantrips in unexpected moments.

You flair point pool is calculated as such: `Character level + DEX Modifier`

## Deft Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can spend 2 flair points to cast a cantrip as a bonus action, instead of an action. On following turns and until it ends, you may interact with it as a bonus action instead of an action.

## Concealed Gesture
Starting at 9th level, you can spend 1 flair point to give yourself advantage on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check when attempting to cast a spell without being noticed.

## Elegant Improvisation
Starting at 13th level, you can spend 3 flair points in order to take an additional reaction, once per round. It can only be used to cast a spell that has the casting time of a reaction, or to perform a [Precarious Riposte](#precarious-riposte).

## Astute Awareness
This feature is yet to be implemented.

# Mischievous Incantations
At 3rd level, you choose two cantrips to specialize in:
- [Deceitful Maneuver](/spells/deceitful-maneuver/)
- [Folly Spectacle](/spells/folly-spectacle/)
- [Fling](/spells/fling/)
- [Minor Phantasm](/spells/minor-phantasm)
- [Subterfuge](/spells/subterfuge/)

You learn them if you don't know them already, and they do not count against your known cantrips. The ones you choose dictate which abilities you attain at higher levels.

---

# Whetted Sleights
Starting at 9th level, you have honed your mischievous incantations, gaining a bonus to the ones you're specialized in.

## Deceitful Maneuver
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Deceitful Maneuver](/spells/deceitful-maneuver/) cantrip, you're no longer required to move at half speed in order to maintain concentration on it.

## Folly Spectacle
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Folly Spectacle](/spells/folly-spectacle/) cantrip, creatures you target have disadvantage on their first saving throw against this spell each turn, as long as they are engaged in combat with another creature.

## Fling
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Fling](/spells/fling/) cantrip, you learn to control the motion of the objects you Fling well enough to determine their orientation. When casting this spell, if you would strike a creature with a sharp object, instead of bludgeoning damage it deals `1d8 piercing damage + your DEX modifier` and takes no damage from impact.

## Minor Phantasm
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Minor Phantasm](/spells/minor-phantasm) cantrip, the first attack agaisnt an affected creature each round has advantage, given that the illusion would realistically distract it.

## Subterfuge
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Subterfuge](/spells/subterfuge/) cantrip, you can cast this spell as a bonus action without spending flair points.

# Second Nature
Starting at 9th level, your mischievous incantations become second nature to you, and you can cast them effortlessly as a free interaction, at a diminished range. If you attempt to do so without being noticed, you gain advantage on the Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

## Deceitful Motion
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Deceitful Maneuver](/spells/deceitful-maneuver/) cantrip, you learn the **Deceitful Motion**. You can cast Deceitful Maneuver freely as part of any interaction, such as drawing a dagger, picking up a pouch, or sitting down. It doesn't require your concentration, but it dispels after you finish the interaction or move 5 feet in any direction.

## Folly Diversion
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Folly Spectacle](/spells/folly-spectacle/) cantrip, you learn the **Folly Diversion**. As your free interaction, you can spend 1 flair point to cast Folly Spectacle targeting one creature you're engaged with.

## Flick
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Fling](/spells/fling/) cantrip, you learn **Flick**. As your free interaction, you can spend 2 flair points to Fling one object within 10 feet of you up to 30 feet in a chosen direction.

## Milder Phantasm
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Minor Phantasm](/spells/minor-phantasm) cantrip, you learn the **Milder Phantasm**. As your free interaction, you can spend 1 flair point to cast Minor Phantasm on a creature within 5 feet of you, and it cannot be larger than a 1-foot cube. It doesn't require your concentration, but it ends at the start of your next turn.

## Subtle Cues
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Subterfuge](/spells/subterfuge/) cantrip, you learn **Subtle Cues**. As your interaction, you can cast Subterfuge and distract one creature within 10 feet of you.

---

# Precarious Riposte
Starting at 13th level, your mischievous incantations become instinctual, allowing you to cast them in a repertoire of unique reactions. If you do so through an [Elegant Improvisation](#elegant-improvisation), you don't need to spend additional flair points.

## Deceitful Dodge
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Deceitful Maneuver](/spells/deceitful-maneuver/) cantrip, you learn the **Deceitful Dodge**. When you're targeted by an attack that relies on sight, you may use your reaction to cast Deceitful Maneuver to give it disadvantage.

You may also move up to 5 feet, given there's an unoccupied area for you to step into and you have enough remaining movement to do so. A ranged attack will automatically miss if you move out of the projectile's path. If you would move out of a creature's engagement range, you must succeed a Dexterity (Stealth) check against its passive perception or provoke an opportunity attack.

## Daunting Display
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Folly Spectacle](/spells/folly-spectacle/) cantrip, you learn the **Daunting Display**. When a creature attempts to move within 30 feet of you, you may spend 1 flair point and use your reaction to cast Folly Spectacle in an attempt to startle it.

The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw in order to tell that it's only an illusion. On failure, it uses its reaction to stop in its tracks and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the round.

## Divert
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Fling](/spells/fling/) cantrip, you learn **Divert**. When you notice a ranged weapon attack, you may spend 2 flair points and use your reaction to try and divert its projectile when it reaches a distance of 30 feet or less from you.

Subtract `1d10 + your DEX modifier` from the attack roll. If the projectile would then miss the target, you may divert it in a direction you choose within a 30-foot cone of the original direction. If you direct the projectile to hit a different target, it can evade it by succeeding a Dexterity saving throw against the modified attack roll. On a hit, the original attacker rolls for damage.

## Momentary Phantasm
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Minor Phantasm](/spells/minor-phantasm) cantrip, you learn the **Momentary Phantasm**. When a creature makes a melee attack within 30 feet of you, you may spend 1 flair point and use your reaction to cast Minor Phantasm in an attempt to interrupt it. The phantasm has to directly affect the attack, such as turning the attacker's weapon to molten lava, creating a splash of acid in its face, etc.

## Sudden Ruse
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Subterfuge](/spells/subterfuge/) cantrip, you learn the **Sudden Ruse**. When an enemy within 30 feet of you makes an attack, you may use your reaction to cast Subterfuge in an attempt to startle that creature, giving it disadvantage on the attack roll.

---

# Flexible Casting
Starting at 17th level,

## Deceitful Glide
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Deceitful Maneuver](/spells/deceitful-maneuver/) cantrip, you learn the **Deceitful Glide**. You may spend 2 flair points to cast Deceitful Maneuver as part of your movement.

##
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Folly Spectacle](/spells/folly-spectacle/) cantrip, you learn the **fuck**.

## Slit
If you're [specialized](#mischievous-incantations) in the [Fling](/spells/fling/) cantrip, you learn **Slit**. When you cast this spell and hit a creature with a blade, it deals `1d10 slashing damage + your DEX modifier` and continues flying until it reaches its maximum range of motion or you decide to stop it. Any additional creatures in its path must succeed a Dexterity saving throw or take the same amount of damage, rolled separately.
