You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.

# Impeccable Timing
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to make your move at exactly the right moment, bewildering your enemies and thwarting their plans. You can take the [[ready]] action as a bonus action in order to prepare a different bonus action that is available to you. Additionally, whenever you take the [[ready]] action, you don't need to use your reaction in order to act when the trigger occurs.

# Thrill of the Chase
Starting at 3rd level, when you use the [[dash]] action, as part of your movement, you can topple over medium objects you pass by, in order to obstruct the path behind you. Additionally, you gain advantage on Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) checks when attempting to overcome obstacles that stand in your way.

# Unwavering
