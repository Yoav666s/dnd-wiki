You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.

# Impeccable Timing
Starting at 3rd level, you learn to surprise your enemies in unexpected moments. You can take the [[ready]] action as a bonus action in order to prepare a different bonus action that is available to you. Additionally, whenever you take the [[ready]] action, you don't need to use your reaction in order to act when the trigger occurs.
