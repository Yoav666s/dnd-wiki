The Shroud Domain draws upon the divine aspects of concealment, illusion, and the unseen. Clerics who follow this path serve deities of night, secrets, or stealth gods who dwell in the boundary between light and dark. These clerics are masters of subterfuge, misdirection, and striking from concealment. In both sacred duty and combat, they walk the threshold between the known and the hidden, shaping the battlefield through silence and shadow.

# Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in [[Stealth]] if you don't already have it.

# Veil of Shadows
Starting at 1st level, you can use your bonus action to take the [[hide]] action. When you restore health while hidden or invisible, you can add your proficiency bonus to the amount of healing done.

# Channel Divinity: Shadow Form
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to allow yourself or another creature to enter shadow form.

As an action, you touch a creature (possibly yourself) and for 1 minute, it has a bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks equal to your Wisdom modifier and it can attempt to [[hide]] even when only lightly obscured by dim light or regular or magical darkness.

# Blend in Shadows
Starting at 6th level, you gain expertise in [[Stealth]].

# Umbral Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

# Lethal Strike
Starting at 17th level, when you hit a creature with a ranged attack from being invisible or hidden, you can deal maximum damage instead of rolling.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
