The Shadow Domain draws upon the divine aspects of concealment, illusion, and the unseen. Clerics who follow this path serve deities of night, secrets, or stealth—gods who dwell in the boundary between light and dark. These clerics are masters of subterfuge, misdirection, and striking from concealment. In both sacred duty and combat, they walk the threshold between the known and the hidden, shaping the battlefield through silence and shadow.

# Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in [[Stealth]] if you don't already have it.

# Trick of the Light
Starting at 1st level, you can use your bonus action to take the [[hide]] action.

When you successfully hide, you can turn invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short rest.

# Channel Divinity: Unseen Strike 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural precision.

When you make a melee weapon attack while invisible, you can use your Channel Divinity to automatically hit and treat the attack as a critical hit. You must declare the use of this feature before making the attack roll.

# Blend in Darkness 
Starting at 6th level, you become engulfed in shadows. You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by darkness or dim light.

# Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

# Shadowling
Starting at 17th level, when you take the [[hide]] action, you automatically succeed.
