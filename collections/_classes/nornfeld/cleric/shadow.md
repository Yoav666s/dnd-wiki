The Shadow Domain draws upon the divine aspects of concealment, illusion, and the unseen. Clerics who follow this path serve deities of night, secrets, or stealth gods who dwell in the boundary between light and dark. These clerics are masters of subterfuge, misdirection, and striking from concealment. In both sacred duty and combat, they walk the threshold between the known and the hidden, shaping the battlefield through silence and shadow.

# Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in [[Stealth]] if you don't already have it.

# Veil of Shadows
Starting at 1st level, you can use your bonus action to take the [[hide]] action.

# Channel Divinity: Shadow Form
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to allow yourself or another creature to enter shadow form.

As an action, you touch a creature (possibly yourself) and for 1 minute, it has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Additionally, it has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

# Misdirection 
Starting at 6th level, when you make a ranged attack from being invisible or hidden, hit or miss, the next attack against the same target has advantage. 

Additionally, you gain expertise in [[Stealth]].

# Umbral Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

# Lethal Strike
Starting at 17th level, when you hit a creature with a ranged attack from being invisible or hidden, you can deal maximum damage instead of rolling.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
