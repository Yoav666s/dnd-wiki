The Shroud Domain draws upon the aspects of concealment, illusion, and the unseen. Clerics who follow this path serve deities of night, secrets, or stealth gods who dwell in the boundary between light and dark. These clerics are masters of subterfuge, misdirection, and striking from concealment. In both sacred duty and combat, they walk the threshold between the known and the hidden, shaping the battlefield through silence and shadow.

# Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in [[Stealth]] if you don't already have it.

# Veil of Shadows
Starting at 1st level, you can use your bonus action to take the [[hide]] action.

# Channel Divinity: Shroud of Shadows
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to bestow a shroud of shadows on a creature.

As an action, a willing creature you touch (possibly yourself) has the invisible condition for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level (to a maximum of 10 rounds), or until it attacks or casts a spell. This effect ends early if you lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

# Shadow Slip
Starting at 6th level, you learn how to slip in and out of the Shadowfell. Immediately after you successfully take the [[hide]] action, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that would give you full cover, or is in dim light or darkness. 

# Umbral Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

# Improved Shadow Slip 
Starting at 17th level, when you use your Shadow Slip feature, the range is increased to 60 feet, and you can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of you. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of your destination space.
