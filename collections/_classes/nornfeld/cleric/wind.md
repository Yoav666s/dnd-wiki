The Wind domain focuses on the ever-changing nature of wind, drawing power from the mythical dragon Elmersodus. It encourages mobility, using movement for advantage, and never staying in one place. Clerics of the Wind Domain revere the ever-changing currents, drawing power from the mythical dragon Elmersodus. They embody motion, change, and freedom—never static, always advancing. These clerics use wind’s swiftness to outmaneuver foes and guide allies to safety.

# Quick Feet
When you choose this domain at 1st level, your walking speed is increased by 10 ft.

# Flow of the Wind
Also starting at 1st level, you learn the [[Wind Blast]] cantrip.

You can take your bonus action to cast [[Expeditious Retreat]] without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Channel Divinity: Havoc
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to cause havoc throughout the battlefield.

When you take the [[dash]] action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Each hostile creature you move within 5 feet of must make a Dexterity saving throw once per turn, if it's on the ground. On failure, it falls prone and takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d4 plus twice your cleric level. 

# Fleeting Soar
Beginning at 6th level, you can command the wind to sweep you off the ground. When you take the [[dash]] action on your turn, you can grant yourself a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of that turn. If you are still airborne when this effect ends, you fall unless you have another means of staying aloft.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Potent Spellcasting
At 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

# Improved Havoc
Starting at 17th level, when you use Havoc, the damage increases to 2d8 plus four times your cleric level.
