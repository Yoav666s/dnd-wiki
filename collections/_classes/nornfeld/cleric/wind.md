The Wind domain focuses on the ever-changing nature of wind, drawing power from deities of nature or storm. It encourages mobility, using movement for advantage, and never staying in one place. Clerics of the Wind Domain revere the ever-changing currents, embodying motion, change, and freedom--Never static, always advancing. These clerics use wind’s swiftness to outmaneuver foes and guide allies to safety.

# Quick Feet
When you choose this domain at 1st level, your walking speed is increased by 5 ft.

Your walking speed is increased by an additional 5 feet when you reach 6th level, and by an additional 10 feet when you reach 17th level.

# Wind Lash
Also starting at 1st level, you can summon wind to ward off a melee attacker. When you're targeted by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to unleash a burst of strong wind towards the attacking creature. It must succeed a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed away 10 feet from you, possibly canceling the attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you gain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. A use is expended only if a target fails its saving throw.

# Channel Divinity: Havoc
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to cause havoc throughout the battlefield.

As an action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Each hostile creature you move within 5 feet of must make a Dexterity saving throw once per turn. On failure, it has the prone condition and takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d4 plus your cleric level. This can only affect a number of creatures equal to up to your proficiency bonus.

# Fleeting Soar
Beginning at 6th level, you can command the wind to sweep you off the ground. When you take the [[dash]] action on your turn, you can grant yourself a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of that turn. If you are still airborne when this effect ends, you fall unless you have another means of staying aloft.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Potent Spellcasting
At 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

# Wind Walker
Starting at 17th level, you always benefit from the effects of the [[Wind Walk]] spell, and you always have it prepared. You can cast it using any appropriate spell slots you have.
