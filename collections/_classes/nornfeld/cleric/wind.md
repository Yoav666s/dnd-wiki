The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy – one of the fundamental forces of the universe – that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrci).

# Quick Feet
When you choose this domain at 1st level, your walking speed is increased by 10 ft.

# Flow of the Wind
Also starting at 1st level, when you take the [[dash]] action, you can drag one medium creature with you, as long as it's not incapacitated. If the creature is unwilling, it must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Wisdom Modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be dragged with you.

You can take your bonus action to cast [[Expeditious Retreat]] without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Channel Divinity: Havoc
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to cause havoc throughout the battlefield.

When you take the [[dash]] action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Each hostile creature you move within 5 feet of must make a Dexterity saving throw once per turn. On failure, it falls prone and takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 plus twice your cleric level. 

# Momentary Soar
Beginning at 6th level, you can command the wind to sweep you off the ground. When you take the [[dash]] action on your turn, you can grant yourself a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of that turn. If you are still airborne when this effect ends, you fall unless you have another means of staying aloft.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

# Supreme Healing
Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
