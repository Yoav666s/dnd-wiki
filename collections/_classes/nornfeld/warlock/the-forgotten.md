Your patron is a forgotten, nameless god, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. He is powerful though formless, and can only communicate through dreams. However, mortals might make a pact with him, allowing him to possess them, taking over their body and using it as his vessel. This is very demanding on the body and can only be sustained for short periods of time, resulting in exhaustion.

# Expanded Spell List
The Forgotten lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells                                         |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| 1st         | [[!Fog Cloud]], [[!Shield]]            |
| 2nd         | [[!Scorching Ray]], [[!Blur]]           |
| 3rd         | [[!Fireball]], [[!Haste]]                  |
| 4th         | [[!Wall of Fire]], [[!Greater Invisibility]] |
| 5th         | [[!Arcane Hand]], [[!Telekinesis]]             |

# Possession
Starting at 1st level, your patron infuses with your body. As an action, you can allow him to possess you, creating a [[fog cloud]] centered on yourself that disperses at the start of your next turn. For one minute, you can cast [[Scorching Ray]] at second level once per turn as an action a number of times equal to your warlock level, without expending spell slots. At the end of the duration, you gain one level of exhaustion (but no more than 3).

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when taking a short rest, you may remove one level of exhaustion instead of recovering your expended spell slots.

# Sickly Aid
Starting at 1st level, your patron enhances your magic when you are weak. When you have at least one level of exhaustion, you gain the following benefits:

- You deal additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus with spell attacks.
- You can cast the [[Shield]] spell without expending a spell slot. Once you do, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Unwavering Defences
Starting at 6th level, your patron is becoming stronger. While you are possessed by your patron, you can cast the [[Shield]] spell as a reaction without expending spell slots. Additionally, while you are possessed, you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level + Charisma modifier and a flying speed of 60 feet.

# Weakly Step
Starting at 6th level, when you have at least two levels of exhaustion, you gain the following benefits:

- After you make a magic attack, you can use your bonus action to [[dash]].
- You can cast [[Misty Step]] as a bonus action without expending a spell slot. Once you do, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.


# Worthy Vessel
Beginning at 10th level, your patron is starting to feel comfortable in your body. While possessed, you can cast [[Telekinesis]] once per possession as an action, without expending a spell slot.

As a bonus action, you can let your patron possess your body until your next turn, granting you all the aforementioned benefits. This does not exhaust your body.

Once you use this feature, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Feeble Excellence
Beginning at 10th level, when you have at least three levels of exhaustion, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain advantage on magic attack rolls.
- You can cast the [[Greater Invisibility]] spell on yourself without expending a spell slot. Once you do, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

# On the Brink of Death
Starting at 14th level, while you are possessed by your patron, your body doesn't suffer from the negative effects of exhaustion. When you drop to 0 hit points, you can let your patron possess your body for one minute, gaining all the aforementioned benefits. After this ends, you gain one level of exhaustion (but no more than 3) and fall unconscious. If you still have any temporary hit points left, you lose them and stabilize.

Once you use this feature, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Might of the Frail
Beginning at 14th level, when you have at least three levels of exhaustion, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain advantage on saving throws against magic.
- You can cast the [[Arcane Hand]] spell without expending a spell slot. Once you do, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
