Your patron is a forgotten, nameless god, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. He is powerful though formless, and can only communicate through dreams. However, mortals might make a pact with him, allowing him to possess them, taking over their body and using it as his vessel. This is very demanding on the body and can only be sustained for short periods of time, resulting in exhaustion.

# Expanded Spell List
The Forgotten lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells                                         |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| 1st         | [[!Fog Cloud]], [[!Shield]]            |
| 2nd         | [[!Detect Thoughts]], [[!Blur]]           |
| 3rd         | [[!Lightning Bolt]], [[!Haste]]                  |
| 4th         | [[!Wall of Fire]], [[!Greater Invisibility]] |
| 5th         | [[!Arcane Hand]], [[!Telekinesis]]             |

# Possession
Starting at 1st level, your patron infuses with your body. As an action, you can allow him to possess you, creating a [[fog cloud]] centered on yourself that disperses at the start of your next turn. For 1 minute, your eyes flare with white light, your voice booms three times as loud as normal, and whenever you deal damage, you deal and additional 1d8 psychic damage. At the end of the duration, you gain one level of exhaustion.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. You cannot use this feature if you have three or more levels of exhaustion.

# Eldritch Recovery
Starting at 1st level, when you take a short rest, you can expend one spell slot to recover one level of exhaustion. 

# Unwavering Defences
Starting at 6th level, your patron is becoming stronger. While you are possessed by your patron, you can cast the [[Shield]] spell as a reaction without expending spell slots. Additionally, while you are possessed, you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level + Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

# Worthy Vessel
Beginning at 10th level, your patron is starting to feel comfortable in your body. While possessed, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet and you can cast [[Telekinesis]] once per possession as an action, without expending a spell slot. When the possession ends, so does the spell.

As a bonus action, you can let your patron possess your body until your next turn, granting you all the aforementioned benefits. This does not exhaust your body.

Once you use this feature, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Last Resort
Starting at 14th level, while you are possessed by your patron, your body doesn't suffer from the negative effects of exhaustion.

When you drop to 0 hit points, you can let your patron possess your body for one minute, gaining all the aforementioned benefits. After this ends, you fall unconscious and gain one level of exhaustion. If you still have any temporary hit points left, you lose them and stabilize.

Once you use this feature, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest. You may use this feature even if you have five levels of exhaustion, but it will result in your death, afterwards.
