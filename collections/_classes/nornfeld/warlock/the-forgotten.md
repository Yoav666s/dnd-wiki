Your patron is a forgotten, nameless god, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. He is powerful though formless, and can only communicate through dreams. However, mortals might make a pact with him, allowing him to possesses them, taking over their body and using it as his vessel. This is very demanding on the body and can only be sustained for short periods of time, resulting in exhaustion.

# Expanded Spell List
The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells                                         |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| 1st         | [[!Command]], [[!Hideous Laughter]]            |
| 2nd         | [[!Scorching Ray]], Phantasmal Force           |
| 3rd         | [[!Blink]], [[!Plant Growth]]                  |
| 4th         | [[!Dominate Beast]], [[!Greater Invisibility]] |
| 5th         | [[!Dominate Person]], [[!Seeming]]             |

# Possession
Starting at 1st level, your patron infuses with your body. As a bonus action, you can allow him to possess you. For one minute, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet and can cast [[Scorching Ray]] as an action for the duration, without spending spell slots. After this ends, you gain one level of exhaustion.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Godly Aim
Starting at 1st level, your patron enhances your magic. When you have at least one level of exhaustion, you have advantage on all magic attack rolls.

# Misty Escape
Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Beguiling Defenses
Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

# Dark Delirium
Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.

Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.

You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.
