The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.

# Fey Teleportation
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Misty Step]] spell as a bonus action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.

# Dazzling Dance
Starting at 7th level, after you make an attack, you can teleport to a free space within 5 feet of a hostile creature you're engaged with.

# Additional Fighting Style
At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.

# Superior Critical
Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.

# Survivor
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
