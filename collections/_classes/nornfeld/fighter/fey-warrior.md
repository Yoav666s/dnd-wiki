The Fey Warrior moves with an otherworldly grace, their presence flickering like moonlight through leaves. Infused with the magic of the Feywild, they are elusive and radiant, vanishing between heartbeats and reappearing where least expected. This archetype blends martial prowess with arcane flair, confusing enemies with dazzling illusions and swift, unpredictable movement. To face a Fey Warrior is to fight a reflection in waterâ€”never quite where you strike, and always a step beyond reach.


# Dazzling Demonstration 
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn the [[Dancing Lights]] and [[Thaumaturgy]] cantrips, and gain proficiency in [[Performance]] if you don't already have it.

# Fey Teleportation
Starting at 3rd level, you learn the [[Phase Strike]] cantrip and you can cast the [[Misty Step]] spell as a bonus action without expending a slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Residual Image
At 7th level, whenever you teleport, you may leave behind an illusory duplicate of yourself. It lasts for 1 minute. For the duration, you can use your bonus action to teleport the duplicate to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

When both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target. A creature can use its action to examine the image, and determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, you no longer gain advantage on attacks against it.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.


# Flicker
Starting at 10th level, when an attack misses you, you may use your reaction to become invisible until the start of your next turn or until you take damage.

# Disappearing Act
At 15th level, when a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack and before damage is rolled, you may use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker. If you do, the attack misses instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses after you finish a short or long rest.

# Fey Invisibility
Starting at 18th level, you learn the [[Greater Invisibility]] spell and you can cast it on yourself without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.
