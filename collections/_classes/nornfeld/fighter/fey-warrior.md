The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.


# Dazzling Demonstration 
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn the [[Dancing Lights]] and [[Thaumaturgy]] cantrips, and gain proficiency in [[Performance]] if you don't already have it.

# Fey Teleportation
Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Misty Step]] spell as a bonus action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.

# Side Step
Starting at 7th level, before you make a melee attack, you may teleport to a free space within 5 feet of a hostile creature you're engaged with.

# Disappearing Act
At 10th level, when you take the [[dash]] action, instead of walking you may teleport to a free space up to a distance equal to your remaining movement speed. You may take one willing creature with you.

# Superior Critical
Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.

# Survivor
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
