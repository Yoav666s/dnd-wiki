Where others rely on brute force or rigid discipline, the Fey Warrior takes a different approach. With a flash of light or a flourish of motion, they become elusive targets and masters of deception. Their presence on the battlefield is as unsettling as it is graceful, never where the enemy expects, never still, and never quite within reach.

# Dazzling Demonstration
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn the [[Dancing Lights]] and [[Subterfuge]] cantrips, and gain proficiency in [[Deception]] if you don't already have it.

# Fey Step
Starting at 3rd level, immediately before you make a melee attack, you can use your bonus action to teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within range of the target of the attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses after you finish a short or long rest.

# Double Vision
At 7th level, you can use your bonus action to create an illusory duplicate of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of you. It moves with you and mimics your actions, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You can't use this feature if you already have an active duplicate.

Each time a creature targets you while you have the duplicate, roll a d20 to determine if the attack hits your duplicate instead of you. On a roll of 11 or higher, the attack targets the duplicate. Its AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits it, the duplicate is destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this feature if it canâ€™t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Disappearing Act
Starting at 10th level, when an attack misses you, you can use your reaction to become invisible until the start of your next turn or until you take damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Flicker
Starting at 15th level, your image shifts and flickers during combat. You gain a +2 bonus to your AC.

# Fey Invisibility
Starting at 18th level, you learn the [[Greater Invisibility]] spell and you can cast it on yourself without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.
