The Fey Warrior moves with an otherworldly grace, their presence flickering like moonlight through leaves. Infused with the magic of the Feywild, they are elusive and radiant, vanishing between heartbeats and reappearing where least expected. This archetype blends martial prowess with arcane flair, confusing enemies with dazzling illusions and swift, unpredictable movement. To face a Fey Warrior is to fight a reflection in waterâ€”never quite where you strike, and always a step beyond reach.


# Dazzling Demonstration 
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn the [[Dancing Lights]] and [[Thaumaturgy]] cantrips, and gain proficiency in [[Performance]] if you don't already have it.

# Fey Teleportation
Starting at 3rd level, you learn the [[Phase Strike]] cantrip and you can cast the [[Misty Step]] spell as a bonus action without expending a slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Residual Image
At 7th level, whenever you teleport, you may leave behind an illusory duplicate of yourself. It lasts until your next turn or until you teleport again.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

When both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

# Disappearing Act
At 10th level, when a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack and before damage is rolled, you may use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker. If you do, the attack misses instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.


# Flicker
Starting at 15th level, when an attack misses you, you may use your reaction to become invisible until the start of your next turn or until you take damage.

# Fey Invisibility
Starting at 18th level, you learn the [[Greater Invisibility]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest.
