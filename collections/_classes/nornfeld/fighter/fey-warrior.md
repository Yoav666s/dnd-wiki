Where others rely on brute force or rigid discipline, the Fey Warrior takes a different approach. With a flash of light or a flourish of motion, they become elusive targets and masters of deception. Their presence on the battlefield is as unsettling as it is graceful, never where the enemy expects, never still, and never quite within reach.

# Fey Energy
Beginning at 3rd level, you possess a wellspring of Fey Energy within yourself. It is represented by your Fey Energy Dice, which fuel powers you gain in this subclass. The Fey Energy Dice table shows the size and number of these dice you have when you reach certain Fighter levels.

## Fey Warrior Energy Dice

| Fighter level | Number | Die Size |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 3rd | 4 | d4 |
| 5th | 6 | d6 |
| 9th | 8 | d8 |
| 13th | 10 | d10 |
| 17th | 12 | d12 |

Some features in this subclass require you to use Fey Energy Dice. You cannot use these abilities if all of your Fey Energy Dice are expended. You regain one of your expended Fey Energy Die when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.

**Augmented Strike.** You can imbue your strike with fey magic. Once per turn, immediately after you hit a creature with an weapon attack, you can expend  a Fey Energy Die, rolling it and and dealing additional Psychic damage equal to the number rolled plus your Charisma modifier.

**Feywild Slip.** You can step in and out of the Feywild. As a bonus action, you can expend a Fey Energy Die, rolling it and multiplying the number rolled by 5 feet. You can magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see, a distance equal up to the result.

# Fey Magic
Also starting at 3rd level, you learn the following spells.

**Find Familiar.** You always have the [[Find Familiar]] spell prepared, and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. The familiar must be a fey, and it can take the form of a [[monsters:Sprite]]. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction.

**Minor Illusion.** You learn the [[Minor Illusion]] cantrip. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

**Subterfuge.** You learn the [[Subterfuge]] cantrip. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma. You can cast [[Subterfuge]] as part of drawing or sheathing a weapon of the light property to teleport it to or from your hand. This doesn't require an action, but it takes as much time as it would normally take to draw or sheath a weapon.

# Fey Adept
Starting at 7th level, you've found new ways to utilize your Fey Energy, detailed below.

**Enchanting Strike.** Once per turn, immediately after you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a Fey Energy Die, rolling it and forcing the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and proficiency bonus). On a failure, the creature has the Charmed condition for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on the Fey Energy Die.

**Vanish.** As a bonus action, you can expend a Fey Energy Die, rolling it and magically giving yourself the invisible condition for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled. Your invisibility ends early if you attack or cast a spell.

# Fey Aptitude
Starting at 10th level, when you roll a number lower than your Charisma modifier on a Fey Energy Die, you can use your Charisma modifier instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Fey Mastery
Starting at 15th level, when you roll for initiative and have no remaining Fey Energy Dice left, you regain one use.

# Major Trickery
Starting at 18th level, you always have the [[Mislead]] spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Fey Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.
