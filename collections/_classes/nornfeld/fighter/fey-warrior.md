Where others rely on brute force or rigid discipline, the Fey Warrior takes a different approach. With a flash of light or a flourish of motion, they become elusive targets and masters of deception. Their presence on the battlefield is as unsettling as it is graceful, never where the enemy expects, never still, and never quite within reach.

# Fey Energy
Beginning at 3rd level, you possess a wellspring of Fey Energy within yourself. It is represented by your Fey Energy Points, which fuel powers you gain in this subclass. The Fey Energy Points table shows the number of these points you have when you reach certain Fighter levels.

| Fighter level | Fey Energy Points |
| :---: | :---: |
| 3rd | 4 |
| 5th | 6 |
| 9th | 8 |
| 13th | 10 |
| 17th | 12 |

Some features in this subclass require you to expend Fey Energy Points. You regain one of your expended Fey Energy Points when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.

**Change Shape.** As an action, you can expend a Fey Energy Point to transform your appearance for 1 hour or until you lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and equipment are not affected by this.

**Charm Person.** You can expend a Fey Energy Point to cast the [[Charm Person]] spell without a spell slot or components. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

**Subterfuge.** You learn the [[Subterfuge]] cantrip. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma. You can cast [[Subterfuge]] as part of drawing or sheathing a weapon of the light property to teleport it to or from your hand. This doesn't require an action, but it takes as much time as it would normally take to draw or sheath a weapon.

# Fey Adept
Starting at 7th level, you learn new ways to use your Fey abilities as detailed below.

**Enlarge/Reduce.** You can expend 2 Fey Energy Points to cast the [[Enlarge/Reduce]] spell without a spell slot or components. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

**Vanish.** You can expend a Fey Energy Point to vanish as a bonus action, gaining the invisible condition until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

# Wondrous Abilities
Starting at 10th level, you learn new ways to use your Fey abilities as detailed below.

**Major Image.** You can expend 3 Fey Energy Points to cast the [[Major Image]] spell without a spell slot or components. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

**Otherworldly Dance.** You can step in and out of the Feywild. As a bonus action you can expend a Fey Energy Point and for the rest of the turn, at the cost of up to 15 feet of your movement, you can magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see, a distance equal up to the movement spent (no action required). You can do so as many times as your movement allows.

# Fey Energy Sustainability
Starting at 15th level, when you finish a short rest, you regain a number of your expended Fey Energy Points equal to your Charisma modifier instead of one.

# Glamorous Magic
Starting at 18th level, you learn additional spells as detailed below.

**Greater Invisibility.** You can expend 4 Fey Energy Points to cast the [[Greater Invisibility]] spell on yourself without a spell slot or components. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

**Dimension Door.** You can expend 4 Fey Energy Points to cast the [[Dimension Door]] spell without a spell slot or components. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.
