Where others rely on brute force or rigid discipline, the Fey Warrior takes a different approach. With a flash of light or a flourish of motion, they become elusive targets and masters of deception. Their presence on the battlefield is as unsettling as it is graceful, never where the enemy expects, never still, and never quite within reach.

# Fey Energy
Beginning at 3rd level, you possess a wellspring of Fey Energy within yourself. It is represented by your Fey Energy Points, which fuel powers you gain in this subclass. The Fey Energy Points table shows the number of these points you have when you reach certain Fighter levels.

| Fighter level | Fey Energy Points |
| :---: | :---: |
| 3rd | 4 |
| 5th | 6 |
| 9th | 8 |
| 13th | 10 |
| 17th | 12 |

Some features in this subclass require you to expend Fey Energy Points. You regain one of your expended Fey Energy Points when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.

**Flicker.** You can use your bonus action to take the [[Dodge]] action, causing your form to blink and flicker.

Once you take this bonus action, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Fey Energy Point (no action required) to restore your use of it.

**Disappear.** When an attack misses you, you can use your reaction to become invisible until the start of your next turn or until you take damage.

Once you take this reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Fey Energy Point (no action required) to restore your use of it.

**Subterfuge.** You learn the [[Subterfuge]] cantrip. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

# Marvelous Abilities
Starting at 7th level, you learn additional spells as detailed below.

**Alter Self.** You can cast the [[Alter Self]] spell without a spell slot or components. Once you do, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest unless you expend 2 Fey Energy Points (no action required) to restore your use of it. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

**Invisibility.** You can cast the [[Invisibility]] spell on yourself without a spell slot or components. Once you do, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest unless you expend 2 Fey Energy Points (no action required) to restore your use of it. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

# Otherworldly Dance
Starting at 10th level, you can step in and out of the Feywild. As a bonus action, you can give yourself extra movement equal to your speed. For the rest of the turn, at the cost of your movement, you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see, a distance equal up to the movement spent (no action required). You can do so as many times as your movement allows.

Once you take this bonus action, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend 2 Fey Energy Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

# The Best Defense
Starting at 15th level, you learn that the best defense is to not be there when it happens. When you're targeted with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, potentially negating the attack.

Once you take this reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend 2 Fey Energy Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

# Glamorous Abilities
Starting at 18th level, you learn additional spells as detailed below.

**Greater Invisibility.** You can expend 3 Fey Energy Points to cast the [[Greater Invisibility]] spell on yourself without a spell slot or components. Once you do, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest unless you expend 3 Fey Energy Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.  Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

**Polymorph.** You can cast the [[Polymorph]] spell on yourself without a spell slot or components. Once you do, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest unless you expend 3 Fey Energy Points (no action required) to restore your use of it. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.
