The Fey Warrior moves with an otherworldly grace, their presence flickering like moonlight through leaves. Infused with the magic of the Feywild, they are elusive and radiant, vanishing between heartbeats and reappearing where least expected. This archetype blends martial prowess with arcane flair, confusing enemies with dazzling illusions and swift, unpredictable movement. To face a Fey Warrior is to fight a reflection in waterâ€”never quite where you strike, and always a step beyond reach.


# Dazzling Demonstration 
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn the [[Dancing Lights]] and [[Thaumaturgy]] cantrips, and gain proficiency in [[Performance]] if you don't already have it.

# Fey Teleportation
Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Misty Step]] spell as a bonus action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.

# Side Step
Starting at 7th level, before you make a melee attack, you may teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of a hostile creature that you can see in melee range. You can use this feature once per turn.

# Disappearing Act
At 10th level, when you're hit with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the attacker. If you do, the attack misses instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.

# Feystride
Starting at 15th level, when you take the [[dash]] action, instead of walking you may teleport to a free space up to a distance equal to your remaining movement speed. You may take one willing creature with you.

# Survivor
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
