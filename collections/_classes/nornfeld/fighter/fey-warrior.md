The Fey Warrior moves with an otherworldly grace, their presence flickering like moonlight through leaves. Infused with the magic of the Feywild, they are elusive and radiant, vanishing between heartbeats and reappearing where least expected. This archetype blends martial prowess with arcane flair, confusing enemies with dazzling illusions and swift, unpredictable movement. To face a Fey Warrior is to fight a reflection in waterâ€”never quite where you strike, and always a step beyond reach.

# Dazzling Demonstration
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn the [[Dancing Lights]] and [[Subterfuge]] cantrips, and gain proficiency in [[Deception]] if you don't already have it.

# Skittery Skip 
Starting at 3rd level, once per turn, you can use up to 10 feet of your movement to teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You cannot use this feature while standing within 5 feet of a hostile creature unless you take the [[disengage]] action.

# Fey Step
Starting at 7th level, you can cast the [[Misty Step]] spell as a bonus action without expending a slot. You can do so twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Disappearing Act
Starting at 10th level, when an attack misses you, you may use your reaction to become invisible until the start of your next turn or until you take damage.

# Flicker
At 15th level, when a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack and before damage is rolled, you may use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker. If you do, the attack misses instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses after you finish a long rest.

# Fey Invisibility
Starting at 18th level, you learn the [[Greater Invisibility]] spell and you can cast it on yourself without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.
