Deadly calm under pressure, Triggermen are specialists who treat the battlefield as a firing range. Their reflexes keep them one step ahead of danger, and their unmatched skill with firearms ensures that every shot counts. Quick to draw and quicker to fire, a Triggerman makes closing the distance a deadly mistake.

# Firearms Specialist
Beginning at 3rd level, you have proficiency with firearms, you ignore the Loading property of firearms, and being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on ranged attack rolls with a firearm.

Additionally, you treat firearms as finesse weapons when making a melee attack with a firearm as an improvised weapon, and you can add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

# Aim Correction 
Starting at 7th level, once per turn, when you miss an enemy with a ranged attack using a firearm, you can give yourself advantage on your next attack roll against that creature until the end of your turn.

# Deadly Precision 
Starting at 10th level, when you make a ranged attack with a firearm, you can treat total cover as three-quarters cover, three-quarters cover as half cover, and ignores half cover.

# Quick Reflexes 
Starting at 15th level, when a creature enters within 15 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make ranged attack with a firearm against it.

# Aim for the Head
Starting at 18th level, you can give yourself disadvantage on a ranged attack roll with a firearm. If you hit, you can treat it as a critical hit.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. The use is not expended when you miss.
