Medics are professional physicians that prove there's no need to rely on magic in order to heal the injured. These trained fighters know how to heal and even revive their comrades after battle.

# Trained Physician
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain expertise with the Medicine skill, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks made to stabilize an Unconscious creature that has 0 hit points.

# Tend Wounds
Starting at 3rd level, as an action you can tend to an injured creature you can see within 5 feet of you (or yourself), expending 1 use of a healer's kit. The creature must be alive and stable. The creature gains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

The number of dice increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels. It becomes 2d6 when you reach 7th level, 3d6 when you reach 10th level, 4d6 when you reach 15th level, and 5d6 when you reach 18th level.

# Patch Up
Starting at 7th level, you can tend to a creature with more extensive care. This process takes 1d6 + 4 minutes and requires you to expend 2 uses of a healer's kit. You can do so over the span of a short rest, and the creatures must be alive, stable, and within 5 feet of you (or yourself). The creature regains hit points equal to 2d10 + your Fighter level + your Medicine modifier. Once a creature has been healed in this way, it must finish a long rest before it can be healed this way again.

The number of dice increases by 1d10 when you reach certain levels. It becomes 3d10 when you reach 10th level, 4d10 when you reach 15th level, and 5d10 when you reach 18th level.

# Revive
Starting at 10th level, expending 5 uses of a healers kit, you can use your action to start reviving a creature that has died within the last minute. This process takes several minutes (until you succeed or fail), during which you need to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check with a DC of 20 minus the creature's Constitution modifier at the end of every minute. You do not have advantage on these checks. If you succeed 3 times, the creature is stabilized with 0 hit points. If you fail 3 times, the creature remains dead and cannot be revived in this way. Successes and failures do not need to be consecutive.

# Resource Management
Starting at 15th level, whenever you use a feature that requires you to expend more than 1 use of a healer's kit, the total uses you need to expend is reduced by your Wisdom modifier to a minimum of 1.

# Supreme Physician
Starting at 18th level, you can tend to a creature that has already been healed with the Tend Wounds or Patch up features if you succeed a Wisdom (Medicine) check with a DC of 20 minus the creature's Constitution modifier. On failure, you can't attempt to tend to that creature again until it finishes a short or long rest.
