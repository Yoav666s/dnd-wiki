# Inspiring Command
Starting at 3rd level, you can inspire your allies through stirring words. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Inspiring Command die, a d6. Once within the next minute, that ally can roll the die and add the number rolled to an attack or damage roll. In the case of an attack roll, this can be done after the d20 is rolled but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Starting at 6th level, you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Inspiring Command die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 6th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 14th level.

# Headstrong Approach 
Starting at 3rd level, you add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.

# Word of Command
Starting at 6th level, once per turn when you take the attack action, you can expend one Inspiring Command die and forgo one attack in order to command one ally that can hear you within 60 feet to make an attack against a creature you choose. That ally can use his or her reaction to make an attack against that creature, rolling the Inspiring Command die and adding the number rolled to their attack or damage roll.

# Valiant Redirection
Starting at 10th level, when a creature targets one of your allies with a melee attack, you can expend one Inspiring Command die and use your reaction to redirect that attack to you, given that you are within reach of that creature. Roll the Inspiring Command die and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll.

# Supreme Commander
Starting at 14th level, when you roll for initiative and have no uses of Inspiring Command left, you regain one use.
