Warriors of Trickery are deviously cunning. They embed the magic and confusing nature of the Feywild in their techniques, beguiling their foes and dazzling their allies. They can change shape and teleport effortlessly around the battlefield.

# Fey Trickery
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you have learned to draw on the power of the Feywild, gaining the following benefits.

**Shapechanger.** You can expend 1 Focus Point to cast the [[Alter Self]] spell without spell components. You can only choose the "Change Appearance" option.

**Misty Step.** You can expend 1 Focus Point to cast the Misty Step spell without spell components.

**Subterfuge.** You know the [[Subterfuge]] spell. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

# Beguiling Step
Also starting at 6th level, immediately before each attack granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If you do and the attack hits, the target has disadvantage on the next attack it makes against you until the start of your next turn. You must teleport within melee range of the target.

# Reliable Misdirection
Starting at 11th level, you learn to turn a missed attack into a distraction. Whenever you miss a creature with a melee attack, you have advantage on the next attack you make against that creature until the end of your turn.

# Improved Misty Step
Starting at 17th level, when you cast the [[Misty Step]] spell, you can bring along one willing or grappled creature you can see within 5 feet of you. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of your destination space. An unwilling grappled creature must succeed a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being teleported with you.
