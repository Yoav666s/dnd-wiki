Monks who follow the Way of the Zen Master embody an unshakable calm in the midst of chaos. To them, battle is not a storm to be weathered but a current to flow with. They seek stillness in motion, clarity in conflict, and mastery through restraint. Rather than striking first, these monks wait—patient, composed, and centered—allowing their foes to reveal their weaknesses.

# Last One Laughing
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you like to go last. After you roll for initiative, you may replace the result with 1. If you do, your first ki ability each turn costs 1 less ki point until the end of combat.

# Move Aside
Starting at 6th level, you learn that the best defense is to not be there when it happens. When you're hit by a melee attack, you may spend one ki point and use your reaction to evade it completely. You may move up to half your movement speed afterwards without provoking opportunity attacks.

# Playful Push
Starting at 11th level, whenever an enemy misses a melee attack against you, you may use your reaction to trip them. They must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On failure they fall [[prone]] and take damage equal to double your martial arts die.

# Presence of Mind
Starting at 17th level, you're mindful of your surroundings. When you choose to replace your initiative roll with 1, until the end of combat:

- The first attack against you each round has disadvantage.
- Your first melee attack each turn has advantage.
- You regain 1 ki point whenever you end your turn without spending key points.
