Monks of the Way of the Zen Master are calm, patient, and quite clever. They learn techniques to outsmart their opponents, conserve ki, and become one with everything.

# He Who Laughs Last
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you like to go last. After you roll for initiative, you may replace the result with 1. If you do, your first ki ability each turn costs 1 less ki point for 1 minute.

# Moving Target
Starting at 6th level, you learn that the best defense is to not be there when it happens. When you're hit by a melee attack, you may spend one ki point and use your reaction to evade it completely. You may move up to half your movement speed afterwards without provoking opportunity attacks.

# Playful Push
Starting at 11th level, whenever an enemy misses a melee attack against you, you may use your reaction to trip them. They must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On failure they fall [[prone]] and take damage equal to double your martial arts die.
