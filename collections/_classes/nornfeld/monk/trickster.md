# Fey Trickery 
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action (or bonus action, depending on the spell), you can spend 2 ki points to cast on yourself [[alter self]], [[invisibility]], or [[misty step]], without providing material components. You also learn the [[Subterfuge]] cantrip if you don't already know it.

# Beguiling Step 
Starting at 6th level, immediately before each attack granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If you do and the attack hits, the target has disadvantage on the next attack it makes against you until the start of your next turn. You must teleport within melee range of the target. 

# Reliable Misdirection 
Starting at 11th level, you learn to turn a missed attack into a distraction. Whenever you miss a creature with a melee attack, you have advantage on the next attack you make against that creature until the end of your turn.

# Fey Mastery
Starting at 17th level, choose one 2nd spell from your Fey Trickery feature. When you cast it, it costs 1 ki point instead of 2.
