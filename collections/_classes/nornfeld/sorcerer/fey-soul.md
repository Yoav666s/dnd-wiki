Your innate magic comes from the distant realms of the Feywild. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its energy and transformed by it.

The power of the Feywild has a noticable effect over your physical presence. The playful aura of magic and trickery is all too present, frustrating and infuriating both friend and foe.

# Fey Magic
You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Feywild Spells table. Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

## Feywild Spells

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
| :------------: | :----- |
| 1st | [[!Charm Person]], [[!Disguise Self]] |
| 3rd | [[!Invisibility]], [[!Misty Step]] |
| 5th | [[!Blink]], [[!Major Image]] |
| 7th | [[!Confusion]], [[!Greater Invisibility]] |
| 9th | [[!Dream]], [[!Modify Memory]] |

Consult the Fey Magic Oddities table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to the Feywild manifests itself whenever you cast any of your sorcerer spells.

## Fey Magic Oddities

| d6    | Oddity |
| :---: | :----- |
| 1 | Various shadows appear around you and silently cheer. |
| 2 | Seasonal flowers sprout on the ground at your feet. |
| 3 | Illusory butterflies circle around you in a spiral. |
| 4 | Silvery tears slowly come down from your eyes. |
| 5 | Glowing writings in sylvan float around you in circles. |
| 6 | Ominous whispers can be heard by you and those affected by your magic. |

# Fey Mind
Being a creature of the Feywild, you are sly and conniving. You can speak, read, and write Sylvan. Whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with fey creatures, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Charmed condition, and magic can't put you to sleep.

# Artful Magic
Starting at 1st level, you can use your bonus action on your turn to teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher.

# Hide and Seek
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your bonus action to become invisible immediately after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. You stay invisible for 1 minute, or until you attack or cast a spell.

# Element of Surprise
Starting at 14th level, whenever you end the invisible condition early by casting a spell, you can expend 1 sorcery point to resume invisibility for the rest of the duration.

# Binding Contract
Starting at 18th level, as an action, you can expend one 9th level spell slot to offer another creature a binding fey contract. The creature must be able to hear you, and the contract must be phrased clearly in a language the creature understands, although you're not required to clarify that it is actually a contract. If it's not obvious that it's a contract, a successful Intelligence saving throw will reveal that it is. If the creature willingly (but not necessarily knowingly) agrees, it is bound by the contract. While bound in this way, the creature takes 5d10 psychic damage whenever it defies the terms of your contract.

A contract can contain one term, which can be phrased innocuously. In the following Term Table is a non-exhaustive list of terms and their respective phrasings.

| d20  | Phrasing | Terms |
| :--: | :------: | :---: |
| 1 | "May I have your name?" | The target cannot use or write down its own name for any purpose, and must use another. You can then use the target's name for any purpose. |
| 2 | "Will you listen to me?" | The target must obey your instructions while you're present. |
| 3 | "May I have a minute of your time?" | The target forgets a chosen minute from their past and  you remember it instead. You must specify to the DM a minute you'd like to steal, which can be a memory you know of or one you describe in general terms. If the memory you specify doesn't exist, the DM chooses another memory instead. |
| 4 | "May I have your attention, please?" | While you can see the target, you can take your action to look and listen through its eyes and ears. |

A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell end this effect.
