You are a ghostly creature, your innate magic coming from the ethereal realm. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy and transformed by it.

The power of ethereal magic casts a strange aura over your physical presence. Your body is still adjusting to the material plane, as if it struggles to remain physical and yearns to return to its ethereal form.

# Poltergeist Sorcerer Quirks
You can pick from or roll on the Poltergeist Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

| d6 | Quirk |
| :--: | :--- |
| 1 | From certain angles, your body is almost transparent. |
| 2 | When you're nervous, soft unintelligible whispers can be heard around you |
| 3 | Your hair seems to float in the air as if you were underwater. |
| 4 | When you fall asleep, your eyes roll up but your eyelids stay open |
| 5 | Your skin has a blue tint to it, and it's almost see-through |
| 6 | Objects around you sometimes rattle or tilt without being touched. |

# Poltergeist Spells
You know the [[Fling]] cantrip and it doesn't count against your cantrips known. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Poltergeist Spells table. Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
| :--: | :--- |
| 1st | Catapult, Cause Fear |
| 3rd | [[Invisibility]], [[Levitate]] |
| 5th | [[Fly]], [[Nondetection]] |
| 7th | [[Confusion]], [[Freedom of Movement]] |
| 9th | [[Animate Objects]], [[Telekinesis]] |

# Momentary Fade
Starting at 1st level, immediately after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your bonus action to send one willing creature you touch to the ethereal realm until the start of your next turn.

# Animate Object
Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to animate one tiny or small object for 1 minute or until you lose concentration, as per the [[Animate Objects]] spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or expend 2 sorcery points to do so.

# Unseen Spectre 
Beginning at 14th level, you can cast [[Invisibility]] on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot. When you cast it this way, you can expend 2 sorcery points so it doesn't require concentration, and it doesn't end early when you cast or deal damage with another spell from your Poltergeist Spells feature.

# Effortless Haunting 
By 18th level, when you cast a spell that requires concentration from your Poltergeist Spells feature, you can expend sorcery points equal to half the spell's level (rounded up) in order for it to not require concentration. The spell ends if you use this feature again.
