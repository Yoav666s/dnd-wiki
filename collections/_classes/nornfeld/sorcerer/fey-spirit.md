Your innate magic comes from the distant realms of the Feywild. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its energy and transformed by it.

The power of the Feywild has a noticable effect over your physical presence. The playful aura of magic and trickery is all too present, frustrating and infuriating both friend and foe.

# Fey Magic
You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Feywild Spells table. Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

## Feywild Spells

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
| :------------: | :----: |
| 1st | [[Disguise Self]], [[Faerie Fire]] |
| 3rd | [[Invisibility]], [[Misty Step]] |
| 5th ||
| 7th ||
| 9th ||

Consult the Fey Magic Oddities table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to the Feywild manifests itself whenever you cast any of your sorcerer spells. 

## Fey Magic Oddities

| 2 | Seasonal flowers sprout on the ground at your feet. |
| 3 | Illusory butterflies circle around you in a spiral. |
| 4 | Silvery tears slowly come down from your eyes. |
| 5 | Glowing writings in sylvan float around you in circles. |
| 6 | Ominous whispers can be heard by you and those affected by your magic. |

# Fey Mind
Being a creature of the Feywild, you are sly and conniving. You can speak, read, and write Sylvan. You have advantage on Charisma ([[Deception]]) or ([[Persuasion]]) checks when interacting with Fey creatures.

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Charmed condition

# Artful Magic
Starting at 1st level, you can use your bonus action on your turn to teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher.
