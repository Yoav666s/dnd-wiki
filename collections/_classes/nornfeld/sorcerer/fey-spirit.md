You are a fey creature, your innate magic coming from the distant realms of the Feywild. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its energy and transformed by it.

The power of the Feywild has a noticable effect over your physical presence. The playful aura of magic and trickery is all too present, frustrating and infuriating both friend and foe.
