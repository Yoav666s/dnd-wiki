Your innate magic comes from the distant realms of the Feywild. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its energy and transformed by it.

The power of the Feywild has a noticable effect over your physical presence. The playful aura of magic and trickery is all too present, frustrating and infuriating both friend and foe.

# Fey Sorcerer Oddity 
Consult the Fey Sorcerer Oddities table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to the Feywild manifests itself whenever you cast any of your sorcerer spells. 

| d6    | Oddity |
| :---: | :----- |
| 1 | Various shadows appear around you and silently cheer. |
| 2 | Seasonal flowers sprout on the ground at your feet. |
| 3 | Illusory butterflies circle around you in a spiral. |
| 4 | Silvery tears slowly come down from your eyes. |
| 5 | Glowing writings in sylvan float around you in circles. |
| 6 | Ominous whispers can be heard by you and those affected by your magic. |

# Fey Tongue 
Being a creature of the Feywild, you are sly and conniving. You can speak, read, and write Sylvan, and you gain expertise in [[Deception]].

# Artful Magic
Starting at 1st level, you can use your bonus action on your turn to teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher.
