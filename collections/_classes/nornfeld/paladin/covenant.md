The Oath of the Covenant is about Fey deals and bargains. It may seem paradoxical to some, as at first glance, the nature of the Feywild is so whimsical and outlandish. However, even in the Feywild there are rules. Contracts and deals are law when it comes to the Fey. They are binding, and those who don't respect them suffer the worst of fates.

# Tenets of Covenant
A paladin who assumes the Oath of Covenant must adhere to the laws of the Feywild. 

*Words are Contracts.* Watch your tongue, for you must keep your word no matter what.

*Honor the Deal.* If you make a contract with someone, there is no going back. You must see it through.

*Demand Retribution.* It is up to you to enforce your terms. If someone doesn't keep their end of a deal, it is up to you to make them pay. 

# Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

# Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

*Illusory Flames.* You can use your Channel Divinity to cause illusory flames to envelope creatures around you. As an action, you force each hostile creature in a 15-foot cube centered on you to make a Dexterity saving throw. On failure, a creature is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice) for 1 minute. For the duration, affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature can’t benefit from being invisible. Every time an affected creature takes damage, it repeats the Dexterity saving throw to end this effect.

*Outwit.* You can use your Channel Divinity to twist your words with wit and enhance your insight. As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to Charisma (Deception) checks and Wisdom (Insight) checks for the next 10 minutes.

# Aura of Covenant 
Beginning at 7th level, the magic of the Feywild is so infused in you that it protects you from mind altering effects. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage against being charmed or frightened, and magic can't put you to sleep.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

# Bait and Switch 
Starting at 15th level, when another friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you is targeted with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport and switch places with it before the attack roll. You must be able to occupy the target creature’s space. You can do so a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

# Fey Form
At 20th level, you gain the ability to embody the magic of the Feywild, engulfing yourself in fey magical effects you choose. For example, floating Sylvan writings might encircle you, your eyes might glow in a violet light, or silvery mist might swirl around you.

As an action, you magically become a Fey for 1 minute, and you gain the following benefits:

- Your creature type is Fey and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
- You can cast Misty Step without expending a spell slot, a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier.
- Your melee attacks deal additional psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
