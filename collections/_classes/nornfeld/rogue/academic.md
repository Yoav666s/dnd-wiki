The Academic is both an experienced rogue and an intellectual, blending wit and talent into a deadly combination. They learn and apply combative techniques, as well as various fields of study. They rely on their sharp cunning no less than their skills, and their brilliant maneuvers can turn the tide in battle.

# Well Studied
Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you learn two languages of your choice, and you have expertise in one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. You choose a second skill to gain expertise in when you reach 9th level.

# Unarmored Technique
Starting at 3rd level, you've learned intricate defensive techniques. While not wearing armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier.

# Risk Estimation
Also starting at 3rd level, you can deduce when things are going to go sideways. You have a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.

# Deep Consideration
Starting at 9th level, when you make an Intelligence skill or ability check, you can give yourself advantage on the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Calculated Strike
Starting at 13th level, once per turn when you make an attack, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll. You can do so after you make the roll, but before the DM decides whether the attack hits or misses.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Brilliant Mind
Starting at 17th level, your Intelligence score increases by 4. Your maximum for this ability score is now 24.
