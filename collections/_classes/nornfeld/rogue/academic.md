The Academic is both an experienced rogue and an intellectual, blending wit and talent into a deadly combination. They learn and apply combative techniques, as well as various fields of study. They rely on their sharp cunning no less than their skills, and their brilliant maneuvers can turn the tide in battle.

# Well Studied
Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you learn two languages of your choice, and you have expertise in one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. You choose a second skill to gain expertise in when you reach 9th level. 

# Cunning Intellect
Starting at 3rd level, when you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, you can choose to roll a Cunning Intellect die, a d6, and add the number rolled to the total of that roll. You can decide to use a Cunning Intellect die after you roll the d20, but before the DM says whether it's a success or a failure.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. when you reach 9th level, you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Cunning Intellect die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 9th level, a d10 at 13th level, and a d12 at 17th level.

# Risk Estimation 
Also starting at 3rd level, you can deduce when things are going to go sideways. You have a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.

# Subtle Sabotage
Starting at 9th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a Cunning Intellect die and subtract the number rolled from that roll.

# Utter Brilliance
Starting at 13th level, when the number rolled on a Cunning Intellect die is lower than your Intelligence modifier, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead.

# Unrivaled Genius 
Starting at 17th level, your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your maximum for this ability score is now 22.
