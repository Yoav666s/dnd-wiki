You have learned to use magic in unexpected and creative ways. You are specialized in mischievous magic tricks not eminently known to the masses, which you use to deceive, outwit, and irritate anyone unlucky enough to cross your path.

# Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

## Cantrips
You learn three cantrips of your choice from the [[rules:mischievous apprentice spell list]]. You learn another cantrip at 10th level.

## Spell Slots
The [[mischievous apprentice spellcasting]] table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.

## Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice.

The Spells Known column of the Mischievous Apprentice Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

## Spellcasting Ability
Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for your spells, since you learn your spells through repeated practice and rely on muscle memory. You use your Dexterity whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Dexterity modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

# Misdirection
Starting at 3rd level, you gain advantage on Dexterity ([[Sleight of Hand]]) checks when trying to cast a spell without being noticed.

# Mischievous Incantations
At 3rd level, choose one cantrip to specialize in. You can use your bonus action to cast it, and gain the following benefits:

## Deceitful Gesture
At 3rd level, if you're specialized in the [[deceitful maneuver]] cantrip, you can cast it freely as part of any interaction, such as drawing a dagger, pulling a lever, or pocketing a piece of jewelry. It doesn't require your concentration, but it dispels after you finish the interaction.

## Sling
At 3rd level, if you're specialized in the [[fling]] cantrip, it is eligible to deal sneak attack damage when an enemy has disadvantage on the saving throw, or when other sneak attack conditions are met.

## False Notion
At 3rd level, if you're specialized in the [[message]] cantrip, you can make a Charisma ([[Deception]]) check in an attempt to make your message feel like a spontaneous thought that has just occurred to the target. On success you gain advantage on any following [[deception]], [[intimidation]], and [[persuasion]] checks on following messages you send to the target.

## Finer Illusion
At 3rd level, if you're specialized in the [[minor illusion]] cantrip, you can animate an image you create. When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can animate the illusion and move it up to 30 feet. You must be within range of it in order to do so, and you cannot move it further than 30 feet of you.

## Extended Phantasm
At 3rd level, if you're specialized in the [[minor phantasm]] cantrip, you can maintain concentration on it for up to an hour.

## Subtle Cues
At 3rd level, if you're specialized in the [[subterfuge]] cantrip, distractions you affect with it can be more artful, for example:
- A whisper can be in a specific voice that you've heard and can consist of up to five words.
- You may interact with more delicate mechanisms, such as belt buckles, straps, and tied knots.
- Physical sensory effects may cause more of a ruse, such as pulling a guard's helmet down to cover his eyes.

[:spells/subterfuge;header:]

# Whetted Sleights
At 9th level, choose a second cantrip to specialize in. Your [[mischievous incantations]] gain additional benefits:

## Deceitful Dash
At 9th level, if you're specialized in the [[deceitful maneuver]] cantrip, you are able to move at normal speed without breaking the effects of this spell.

## Pitch
At 9th level, if you're specialized in the [[fling]] cantrip, its damage die is replaced for you with 1d12 instead of 1d8.

## Wily Whisper
At 9th level, if you're specialized in the [[message]] cantrip, you can cast it as an interaction instead of an action.

## Louder Illusion
At 9th level, if you're specialized in the [[minor illusion]] cantrip, you can cause sound to emanate from an image you create instead of moving it. You can animate it to match the sound.  

## Uncanny Phantasm
At 9th level, if you're specialized in the [[minor phantasm]] cantrip, if you manage to concentrate on the illusion for the full hour, the spell lasts until dispelled, or until the target succeeds an Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check against it.

## Sly Confusion
At 9th level, if you're specialized in the [[subterfuge]] cantrip, you may cast this spell in order to distract a creature. The next attack against it has advantage until your next turn.

# Precarious Riposte
Starting at 13th level, the [[mischievous incantations]] you've specialized in become instinctual, allowing you to cast them in a repertoire of unique reactions.

## Deceitful Dodge
At 13th level, if you're specialized in the [[deceitful maneuver]] cantrip, you learn the **deceitful dodge** riposte. When you're targeted by an attack that relies on sight, you may use your reaction to cast [[deceitful maneuver]] and attempt to move up to 5 feet, given there's an unoccupied area for you to step into and you have enough remaining movement to do so. Make a Dexterity saving throw against the attack roll. On success, you evade it completely. On failure, you take half damage. Your movement doesn't provoke an opportunity attack from that creature.

## Divert
At 13th level, if you're specialized in the [[fling]] cantrip, you learn the **divert** riposte. When you notice a ranged weapon attack, you may use your reaction to try and divert its projectile when it reaches a distance of 60 feet or less from you.

Subtract 1d10 + your DEX modifier from the attack roll. If the projectile would then miss, you may divert it in a direction you choose within a 30-foot cone of the original direction. If you direct the projectile to hit a different target, it then must make a Dexterity saving throw against the modified attack roll. On failure, the original attacker rolls for damage.

## Intrusive Thoughts
At 13th level, if you're specialized in the [[message]] cantrip, you learn the **intrusive thoughts** riposte. When you notice a creature taking any action within range, you may use your reaction to cast [[message]] in an attempt to intervene.

## Minor Inconvenience
At 13th level, if you're specialized in the [[minor illusion]] cantrip, you learn the **minor inconvenience** riposte. When an enemy starts its turn within 30 feet of an illusion you created, you may use your reaction to make the illusion taunt it.

The enemy must succeed an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC or focus its attention on the illusion. The enemy automatically succeeds the saving throw if it already knows it's an illusion.

## Momentary Phantasm
At 13th level, if you're specialized in the [[minor phantasm]] cantrip, you learn the **momentary phantasm** riposte. When a creature makes a melee attack within 30 feet of you, you may use your reaction to cast [[minor phantasm]] in an attempt to interrupt it.

The attacker must make an Intelligence saving throw. On failure, the phantasm takes effect and the attack is prevented. The phantasm you create must directly affect the attack, such making the attacker's weapon appear as a snake. This requires your concentration.

## Sudden Ruse
At 13th level, if you're specialized in the [[subterfuge]] cantrip, you learn the **sudden ruse** riposte. When a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack, you may use your reaction to cast [[subterfuge]] in an attempt to startle, confuse, or distract that creature, giving it disadvantage on the attack roll.

---

# Elegant Improvisation
Starting at 17th level, you can take an additional reaction once per round, and only in order to cast a spell that has the casting time of 1 reaction, or to perform a [[precarious riposte]]. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half you proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
