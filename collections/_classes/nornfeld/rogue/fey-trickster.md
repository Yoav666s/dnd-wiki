Starting at 3rd level, you learn the [[Subterfuge]] cantrip. When you use it to teleport an object you are carrying to your hand, you can do so as an interaction with the object.

Additionally, you learn the [[Unseen Servant]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you do, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.
