You're skilled in close-quarter fighting, especially in densely packed areas. You take advantage of the crowd, of others' mistakes, and of opportune moments. Your dirty tactics and dangerous stunts always give you an edge, whether you're plundering a ship, fighting off trespassers, or brawling in your local tavern.

# Deckhand Jostler
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, another creature's space does not count as [[difficult terrain]] for you. You can also move through a hostile creature's space regardless of its size, but you provoke an [[opportunity attack]] by doing so.

Whenever you move through a hostile creature's space, the next attack it makes against you has disadvantage until your next turn.

# Impressionable Tactics
Starting at 3rd level, you always wait for the right moment to act. When you take the [[Ready]] action, you don't need to use your reaction in order to act when the trigger occurs.

You may also ready a bonus action instead of taking it immediately. If you ready a bonus action granted to you by [[Cunning Action@rogue]], you may move up to your remaining movement speed before or after you do so.

# Ready for a Row
Starting at 3rd level, you can add your [[proficiency bonus]] to your [[initiative]] rolls. On the first round of combat, if you're the first to act, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make that round.

# Anticipatory Dodge
Starting at 9th level, when you end your turn in combat without making an attack, the next attack against you before the start of your next turn has disadvantage.

# Unsavory Exploits
Starting at 13th level, whenever a creature makes an attack with disadvantage against you, you can use your reaction to make an [[opportunity attack]] against that creature. You have advantage on the attack roll.

# Golden Opportunity
Beginning on 17th level, when you use your reaction to make an [[opportunity attack]], it can benefit from your [[Sneak Attack@rogue]] even if you have already dealt sneak damage this round.
