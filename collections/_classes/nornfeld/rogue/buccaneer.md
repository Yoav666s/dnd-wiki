You're skilled in close-quarter fighting, especially in densely packed areas. You take advantage of the crowd, of others' mistakes, and of opportune moments. Your dirty tactics and dangerous stunts always give you an edge, whether you're plundering a ship, fighting off trespassers, or brawling in your local tavern.

# Deckhand Jostler
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your bonus action to attempt to [[shove]] a creature. Instead of making a Strength ([[Athletics]]) check, you can make a Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check.

**2024 Ruleset** \
*Starting at 3rd level, you can use your bonus action to attempt to [[shove]] a creature. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and your proficiency bonus.*

# Ready for a Row
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can add your [[proficiency bonus]] to your [[initiative]] rolls.

# Brief Distraction
Starting at 9th level, whenever you attempt to [[shove]] a creature, succeed or fail, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature until the end of your turn.

# Unsavory Exploits
Starting at 13th level, when a creature that has the [[prone]] condition tries to use its movement to get up within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make an [[opportunity attack]] against that creature. 

# Dirty Tactics
Beginning on 17th level, when you attack a creature with the [[prone]] condition, a roll of 18-20 counts as a critical hit.
