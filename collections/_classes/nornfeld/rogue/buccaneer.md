You're skilled in close-quarter fighting, especially in densely packed areas. You take advantage of the crowd, of others' mistakes, and of opportune moments. Your dirty tactics and dangerous stunts always give you an edge, whether you're plundering a ship, fighting off trespassers, or brawling in your local tavern.
