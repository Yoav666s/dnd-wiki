Mirage Dancers are trained in subtle magic, using illusions to enhance their roguish abilities. They are masters of misdirection, beguiling friend, foe, and everything in between. The source of their magic is likely tied to the Feywild.

# Dancer's Grace
Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, when you hit a target with a weapon attack using a Scimitar that isn't a result of the light property, you have advantage on the next attack you make against the same target until the end of your next turn.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll if you move at least 10 feet while staying within 5 feet of the target before making the attack and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

# Level 3: Mirage
When you take the Disengage action, you can give yourself the invisible condition until the start of your next turn and create an illusory duplicate of yourself that appears in your space and lasts for the duration. This effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell or lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

The duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. Your invisibility ends early if the duplicate is destroyed.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest 

# Level 9: Greater Misdirection
You always have [[Mirror Image]] prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma. Once you cast it with this feature, you can't do it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

If you use your Mirage feature while [[Mirror Image]] is active, the illusory duplicates created by this spell stay in the illusion's space instead of moving with you until you become visible.

# Level 13: Dance of Death
After you make an Opportunity Attack, you can immediately make another attack with a different weapon you're holding that has the light property, as part of the same reaction.

# Level 17: Dance Master
After a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make an Opportunity Attack against that creature.
