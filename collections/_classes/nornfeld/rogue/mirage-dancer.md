Mirage Dancers are trained in subtle magic, using illusions to enhance their roguish abilities. They are masters of misdirection, beguiling both friend, foe, and everything in between. The source of their magic is likely tied to the Feywild.

# Illusory Powers
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you harbor a wellspring of Fey energy within yourself. It is represented by your Mirage Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass. The Mirage Dancer Dice table shows the number of these dice you have when you reach certain Rogue levels, and the table shows the die size.

| Rogue Level | Die Size | Number |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 3 | d4 | 4 |
| 5 | d6 | 6 |
| 9 | d8 | 8 |
| 13 | d10 | 10 |
| 17 | d12 | 12 |

Any features in this subclass that use a Mirage Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend a Mirage Die, as specified in the power's description, and you can't use the power if it requires you to use a die when your Mirage Dice are all expended.

You regain one of your expended Mirage Dice when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.

**Mirage.** You can use your bonus action to expend a Mirage Die, rolling it, and turn invisible at the same time as an illusory duplicate of yourself appears instead of you. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on the Mirage Die, or until you attack, cast a spell, or lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). This effect also ends early if another creature touches you or your illusion. If you're at the same position as your illusion when this effect ends, you can assume the same pose of your illusion to appear like you've been there all along. Otherwise, it would seem like you've teleported to your current position. If a creature uses its action to examine the duplicate, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

**Disguise Self.** You always have [[Disguise Self]] prepared, and your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components. If you have an illusory duplicate while disguised in this way, it looks like your disguise.

**Silent Image.** You always have [[Silent Image]] prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components to create an illusory duplicate of yourself. If you use this spell to create anything else, you must expend a Mirage Die (or a spell slot) to do so. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

# Trick of the Light
Starting at 9th level, you learn new ways to use your abilities, detailed below.

**Major Image.** You always have [[Major Image]] prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components to create an illusory duplicate of yourself. If you use this spell to create anything else, you must expend 3 Mirage Dice (or a spell slot) to do so. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

**Mirror Image.** You always have [[Mirror Image]] prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components if you expend 2 Mirage Dice to do so. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

# Greater Misdirection
Starting at 13th level, you learn new ways to use your abilities, detailed below.

**Illusory Step.** When you're hit with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend a Mirage Die, rolling it and subtracting the number rolled from the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to miss. You can do so after the DM declares the hit but before the damage is rolled.

**Mislead.** You always have [[Mislead]] prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma. Once you cast this spell with this feature, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest unless you expend 5 Mirage Dice to restore your use of it.

# Master of Mischief
Starting at 17th level, you learn new ways to use your abilities, detailed below.

**Illusory Army.** When you cast [[Silent Image]] or [[Major Image]] to create an illusory duplicate of yourself, you can concentrate on a number of illusory duplicates created this way equal to your Charisma modifier simultaneously.

**Project Image.** You always have [[Project Image]] prepared. With this feature, you can expend 7 Mirage Dice to cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.
