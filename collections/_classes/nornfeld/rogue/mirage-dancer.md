Trained in both subtle magic and sleight of hand, a Mirage Dancer slips unseen between moments, vanishes in plain sight, and reappears where least expected. Whether vanishing behind a ripple of heat, escaping pursuit through illusory doubles, or seeming to teleport across the battlefield, they master the art of being where danger is not.
