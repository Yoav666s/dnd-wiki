Trained in both subtle magic and sleight of hand, a Mirage Dancer slips unseen between moments, vanishes in plain sight, and reappears where least expected. Whether vanishing behind a ripple of heat, escaping pursuit through illusory doubles, or seeming to teleport across the battlefield, they master the art of being where danger is not.

# Mirage Points
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain Mirage Points equal to your half your rogue level (rounded up). They are used to fuel your Mirage Dancer abilities, and you regain your expended Mirage Points when you finish a short rest.

# Mirage
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your bonus action to expend 1 Mirage Point and turn invisible at the same time as an illusory duplicate of yourself appears instead of you. This lasts until the start of your next turn, or until you attack, cast a spell, or lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). This effect also ends early if another creature touches you or your illusion, or if you move more than 30 feet away from your duplicate.

If you're at the same position as your illusion when this effect ends, you can assume the same pose of your illusion to appear like you've been there all along. Otherwise, it would seem like you've teleported to your current position.

# Illusory Double
Also starting at 3rd level, you learn the [[Minor Illusion]] cantrip if you don't already know it, and you can cast it as a bonus action. When you cast it to create an image, you can expend 1 Mirage Point to create a full-size image of yourself. If you do so, for the duration you can use your bonus action to move the illusion to an unoccupied space within range and animate it to match its movement.

# Trick of the Light
Starting at 9th level, you learn the [[Invisibility]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest or expend 3 Mirage Points. For the duration, you can cast [[Minor Illusion]] without ending the effect.

# Greater Misdirection
Starting at 13th level, you learn the [[Mislead]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest or expend 5 Mirage Points.

Additionally, when you create an Illusory Double with [[Minor Illusion]], for the duration you can use your bonus action to cause it to speak in your voice and carry on conversation.

# Artful Riposte 
Starting at 17th level, when a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 Mirage Point and use your Mirage feature to make a melee attack against that creature.
