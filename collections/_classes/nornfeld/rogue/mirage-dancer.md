Mirage Dancers are trained in subtle magic, using illusions to enhance their roguish abilities. They are masters of misdirection, beguiling both friend, foe, and everything in between. The source of their magic is likely tied to the Feywild.

# Mirage Points
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain Mirage Points equal to your half your rogue level (rounded up). They are used to fuel your Mirage Dancer abilities, and you regain your expended Mirage Points when you finish a short or long rest.

# Mirage
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your bonus action to expend 1 Mirage Point and turn invisible at the same time as an illusory duplicate of yourself appears instead of you. This lasts until the start of your next turn, or until you attack, cast a spell, or lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). This effect also ends early if another creature touches you or your illusion.

If you're at the same position as your illusion when this effect ends, you can assume the same pose of your illusion to appear like you've been there all along. Otherwise, it would seem like you've teleported to your current position.

If a creature uses its action to examine the duplicate, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

# Illusory Mischief
Also starting at 3rd level, you learn the [[Minor Illusion]] cantrip. Additionally, you learn the [[Silent Image]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot or providing material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest or expend 1 Mirage Point. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

# Trick of the Light
Starting at 9th level, you learn the [[Invisibility]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot or providing material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest or expend 2 Mirage Points. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

# Greater Misdirection
Starting at 13th level, you learn the [[Mislead]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest or expend 3 Mirage Points. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

# Supreme Illusionist
Starting at 17th level, when you roll for initiative and have no remaining Mirage Points, you regain a number of Mirage Points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
