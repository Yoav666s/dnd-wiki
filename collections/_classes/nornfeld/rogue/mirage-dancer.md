Mirage Dancers are trained in subtle magic, using illusions to enhance their roguish abilities. They are masters of misdirection, beguiling both friend, foe, and everything in between. The source of their magic is likely tied to the Feywild.

# Illusory Powers
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, harbor a wellspring of Fey energy within yourself. It is represented by your Mirage Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass. The Mirage Dancer Dice table shows the number of these dice you have when you reach certain Rogue levels, and the table shows the die size.

| Rogue Level | Die Size | Number |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 3 | d6 | 4 |
| 5 | d8 | 6 |
| 9 | d8 | 8 |
| 11 | d10 | 8 |
| 13 | d10 | 10 |
| 17 | d12 | 12 |

Any features in this subclass that use a Mirage Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend a Mirage Die, as specified in the power's description, and you can't use the power if it requires you to use a die when your Mirage Dice are all expended.

You regain one of your expended Mirage Dice when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.

# Mirage
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your bonus action to expend 1 Mirage Point and turn invisible at the same time as an illusory duplicate of yourself appears instead of you. This lasts until the start of your next turn, or until you attack, cast a spell, or lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). This effect also ends early if another creature touches you or your illusion.

If you're at the same position as your illusion when this effect ends, you can assume the same pose of your illusion to appear like you've been there all along. Otherwise, it would seem like you've teleported to your current position.

If a creature uses its action to examine the duplicate, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

# Illusory Mischief
Also starting at 3rd level, you learn the [[Minor Illusion]] and [[Subterfuge]] cantrips. Additionally, you learn the [[Silent Image]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot or providing material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest or expend a Mirage Point. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

# Trick of the Light
Starting at 9th level, you learn the [[Invisibility]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot or providing material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest or expend 2 Mirage Points. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

# Greater Misdirection
Starting at 13th level, you learn the [[Mislead]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest or expend 5 Mirage Points. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

# Master of Mischief
Starting at 17th level, you learn the [[Project Image]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest or expend 7 Mirage Points. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
