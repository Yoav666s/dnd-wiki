Trained in both subtle magic and sleight of hand, a Mirage Dancer slips unseen between moments, vanishes in plain sight, and reappears where least expected. Whether vanishing behind a ripple of heat, escaping pursuit through illusory doubles, or seeming to teleport across the battlefield, they master the art of being where danger is not.

# Mirage
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your bonus action to turn invisible at the same time as an illusory duplicate of yourself appears instead of you. This lasts until the start of your next turn, or until you attack, cast a spell, or lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). This effect also ends early if another creature touches you or your illusion.

If you're at the same position as your illusion when this effect ends, you can assume the same pose of your illusion to appear like you've been there all along. Otherwise, it would seem like you've teleported to your current position.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. When you use this feature and end the effect by willingly dropping concentration on it before the end of your turn, you can do so without expending a use.

# Novice Illusionist 
Also starting at 3rd level, you learn the [[Minor Illusion]] cantrip. You also learn the [[Silent Image]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Trick of the Light
Starting at 9th level, you learn the [[Invisibility]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, while you are invisible, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

# Adept Illusionist
Starting at 13th level, you learn the [[Major Image]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when you use your Mirage feature, you can cause your duplicate to speak for the duration.

# Greater Misdirection
Starting at 17th level, you learn the [[Mislead]] spell and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.
