Mirage Dancers are trained in subtle magic, using illusions to enhance their roguish abilities. They are masters of misdirection, beguiling friend, foe, and everything in between. The source of their magic is likely tied to the Feywild.

# Master of Mischief
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain new abilities, detailed below.

**Disguise Self.** You always have [[Disguise Self]] prepared, and your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components. If you have an illusory duplicate while disguised in this way, it looks like your disguise.

**Illusory Duplicate.** As a bonus action, you magically create an illusory duplicate of yourself which appears in your space or at an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet and lasts for 1 minute or until you lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). If you are within range of the illusion, you can use your bonus action to cause it to move to another spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature that takes an action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Charisma modifier. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

**Minor Illusion.** You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. Your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.

# Smooth Talker
Also starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Deception skill, and in the Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion skill.

# Agent of Chaos
Starting at 9th level, you learn new ways to enhance your Illusory Duplicate ability.

**Illusory Army.** You can concentrate on a number of illusory duplicates equal to your Charisma modifier, but you can only create one at a time with your bonus action.

**Sly Swap.** You can use your bonus action to switch places with an illusory duplicate if you are within 30 feet of it. You can do so a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Master of Deceit
Starting at 13th level, you learn new ways to enhance your Illusory Duplicate ability.

**Deceitful Distraction.** You can treat an illusory duplicate as an ally while it is within 5 feet of a creature that can see it for the purposes of enabling your Sneak Attack. This doesn't work if the creature is aware that it is an illusion.

**Misleading Maneuver.** When you create an illusory duplicate in your space, you can turn invisible at the same time for the duration. You can do so a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. The invisibility ends early if you attack, cast a spell, or lose concentration on the duplicate.

# Distant Projection
Starting at 17th level, when you create an illusory duplicate, you can increase the range to 500 miles. The duplicate can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. When you do so, you can concentrate on the duplicate for up to 10 minutes, and you can see through the illusion’s eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
