Trained in both subtle magic and sleight of hand, a Mirage Dancer slips unseen between moments, vanishes in plain sight, and reappears where least expected. Whether vanishing behind a ripple of heat, escaping pursuit through illusory doubles, or seeming to teleport across the battlefield, they master the art of being where danger is not.

# Deceitful Gesture
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn the [[Mirage]] cantrip, and you can cast it as a bonus action.

Additionally, you can cast [[Mirage]] freely as part of any interaction, such as drawing a dagger, pulling a lever, or pocketing a piece of jewelry. It doesn't require your concentration, but it dispels after you finish the interaction.

# Trick of the Light
Starting at 3rd level, you learn the [[Hide in Shadows]] spell, and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, while you are invisible, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

# Deceitful Dash
Starting at 9th level, you can ignore movement restrictions when casting [[Mirage]].

Additionally, you can cast it as part of the [[dash]] action. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Deceitful Dodge
Starting at 13th level, you can cast [[Mirage]] instinctively. When you're targeted by an attack that relies on sight, you may use your reaction to cast [[Mirage]] and attempt to move up to 5 feet, given there's an unoccupied area for you to step into and you have enough remaining movement to do so. Make a Dexterity saving throw against the attack roll. On success, you evade it completely. On failure, you take half damage.

# Elegant Improvisation
Starting at 17th level, you can take an additional reaction, but only in order to perform a [[Deceitful Dodge]]. After you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
