Mirage Dancers are trained in subtle magic, using illusions to enhance their roguish abilities. They are masters of misdirection, beguiling friend, foe, and everything in between. The source of their magic is likely tied to the Feywild.

# Level 3: Dancer's Grace
You gain proficiency in the Deception skill and you can use the mastery property of Scimitars. Additionally, when you make an attack with a Scimitar that isn't a result of the light property, you can treat it as though the Scimitar has the Vex property for that attack.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll if you move at least 10 feet while staying within 5 feet of the target before making the attack and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

# Level 3: Mirage
When you take the Disengage action, you can give yourself the invisible condition until the start of your next turn and create an illusory duplicate of yourself that appears in your space and lasts for the duration. Your invisibility ends early if you attack or cast a spell.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. When you reach level 9 in this class, you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest 

# Level 9: Dance of Deceit
You always have [[Mirror Image]] prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma. Once you cast it with this feature, you can't do it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

# Level 13: Greater Misdirection 
You always have [[Mislead]] prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma. Once you cast it with this feature, you can't do it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

# Level 17: Dance Master
After a creature makes a melee attack against you, you can use your reaction to make an Opportunity Attack against that creature.
