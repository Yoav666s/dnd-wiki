A Hitman strikes with lethal precision, blending rapid, methodical attacks with uncanny perception. Skilled with firearms and sharp instincts, they can follow up shots instantly, exploit openings, and turn careful observation into deadly advantage. At their peak, a Hitman can deliver multiple precision strikes in a single turn, making every shot count.

# Firearm Expert
Beginning at 3rd level, you have proficiency with firearms, you ignore the Loading property of firearms, and being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on ranged attack rolls with a firearm. Additionally, you treat firearms as finesse weapons when making a melee attack with a firearm as an improvised weapon, and you can add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

# Rapid Shot
Starting at 3rd level, when you make a ranged attack with a firearm, you can use your bonus action to make another ranged attack with the same weapon. You donâ€™t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

# Sharp Instincts
Starting at 9th level, once per turn when you make a ranged attack, you can make a Wisdom (Perception) check against the target's AC. If you succeed, you have advantage on the attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. The use is not expended when you fail the Wisdom (Perception) check.

# Astute Aim
Starting at 13th level, once per turn when you make a ranged attack, you can add your Perception modifier to the attack roll. You can use this feature after you roll for the attack but before the DM declares whether it hits or misses.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Deadly Shot
Starting at 17th level, when you make a ranged attack with your Rapid Shot feature, it's eligible to deal Sneak Attack damage even if your had already dealt Sneak Attack damage this turn. Sneak Attack requirements still apply.
