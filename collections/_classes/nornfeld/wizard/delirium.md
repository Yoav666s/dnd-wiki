***You must own a copy of the [[items:Tome of Fey Secrets]] to select this school.***

As a member of the School of Delirium, you have learned to contain the knowledge inside the Tome of Fey Secrets without going mad. The more you progress in studying the tome, the less dependent you are on it. And as you learn about madness, the more dangerous you become.

# Delirium Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell from the Tome of Fey Secrets into your spellbook is halved, and you can do so without attuning to the tome. Additionally, you can break your attunement to the tome without casting [[Remove Curse]] on it.

# Maddening Whispers
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you can communicate telepathically with a creature within 60 feet of you. You can disguise your voice as a whisper while doing so, making it unrecognizable.

# Frightening Gaze
When you reach 6th level, you can use your bonus action to force another creature within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On failure, it becomes frightened of you until the end of its next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Resilience of the Mind
Starting at 10th level, you have resistance to psychic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

# Slippery Slope
Starting at 14th level, when you cast a spell from the Tome of Fey Secrets that forces the target to make a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on that saving throw for one target.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
