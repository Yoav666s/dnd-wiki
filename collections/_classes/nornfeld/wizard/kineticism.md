# Light Fling
When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the [[Fling]] cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

You can cast Fling as part of the same action you use to interact with an object, but only to send an object to your free hand and catch it. 

# Extra Fling
Beginning at 2nd level, when you take your action to cast [[Fling]], you can cast it again as a bonus action. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Divert
Starting at 6th level, the [[Fling]] cantrip becomes instinctive for you. When you notice a ranged weapon attack, you may use your reaction to try and divert its projectile when it reaches a distance of 60 feet or less from you.

Subtract 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier from the attack roll. If the projectile would then miss, you may divert it in a direction you choose within a 30-foot cone of the original direction. If you direct the projectile to hit a different target, it then must make a Dexterity saving throw against the modified attack roll. On failure, the original attacker rolls for damage.

# Empowered Cantrip
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to damage rolls of any wizard cantrip that you cast.

# Cantrip Overcharge 
Starting at 14th level, you can channel more energy into your cantrips. When you take your action to cast a cantrip, you may expend a spell slot to increase its damage. When you cast a cantrip with a spell slot of 1st level or higher, its damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level.
