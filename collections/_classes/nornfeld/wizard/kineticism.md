Through intense focus and mathematical precision, Kineticists wield invisible forces to propel objects, redirect projectiles, and strike foes with surgical accuracy. To them, magic is not chaosâ€”it is controlled energy, harnessed and released with perfect timing. Their battlefield is not defined by fire or frost, but by space, speed, and direction.

# Flinger
When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the [[Fling]] cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

Additionally, you can cast Fling as part of an interaction with an object, but only to send an object to your free hand and catch it.

# Extra Fling
Beginning at 2nd level, when you take your action to cast [[Fling]], you can cast it again as a bonus action. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

# Divert
Starting at 6th level, the [[Fling]] cantrip becomes instinctive for you. When you notice a ranged weapon attack, you may use your reaction to try and divert its projectile when it reaches a distance of 60 feet or less from you.

Subtract 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier from the attack roll. If the projectile would then miss, you may divert it in a direction you choose within a 30-foot cone of the original direction. If you direct the projectile to hit a different target, it then must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On failure, the original attacker rolls for damage.

# Empowered Cantrip
Beginning at 10th level, you add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to damage rolls of any wizard cantrip that you cast.

# Disarm 
Starting at 14th level, you can disarm an enemy as a bonus action. Choose a creature you can see within 60 feet. You may fling one object that it's holding up to 60 feet away. You may send it to one of your free hands and catch it.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
