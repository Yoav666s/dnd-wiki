***You must own a copy of the [[items:Tome of Fey Secrets]] to select this college.***

As a member of the College of Madness, you have learned to contain the knowledge inside the Tome of Fey Secrets without going mad. The more you progress in studying the tome, the less dependent you are on it. And as you learn about madness, the more dangerous you become.

# Student of Madness 
Beginning when you choose this college at 3rd level, in addition to spells from the Bard spell list, you can learn spells from the Tome of Fey Secrets without attuning to it. Additionally, you can break your attunement to the tome without casting [[Remove Curse]] on it.

# Weaken the Mind
Starting at 3rd level, you learn how to weaken the mind of your foes. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.

# Bewildering Words
Starting at 6th level, when one of your allies deals damage to a creature, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and dealing additional psychic damage equal to the number rolled. The target then has disadvantage on its next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw until the end of your next turn.

# Aura of Insanity 
At 14th level, once per turn when you deal psychic damage to another creature, you deal additional damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
