# Introduction 
This stealth-focused adventure is intended for one player and one DM, and it can start dynamically when a player arrives at [[lore:Gullenshire@hoverncast]], a small port city in [[lore:Hoverncast]]. In a campaign with more than one PC, one can be singled out by speaking to Moreau in private.

## Running the Adventure
Darling of the Docks is a short adventure intended for one character of 5th level. The goal of this adventure is to introduce the player to a crime syndicate called [[the Network]], the headquarters of which are located in Gullenshire. Gullenshire is the smallest and most prosperous port city of Hoverncast, the west coast of [[Durn]].

The player or party don't have to know that the adventure has started in order to participate in it. It is recommended to dynamically introduce characters and it's okay to go off-script. Let the player lead the adventure and lean on key-events when they feel stuck or struggle with figuring out what to do.

If there is more than one player, the characters in this adventure will focus on the stealthiest one, as if sensing great potential in them. This can serve as a personal arc for one character within the party.

# Part 1: Enjoy the Show

The adventure begins when they player or the party arrives in the city of Gullenshire. They are free to explore the city. When asking around or looking for a tavern, they will find [[the Thirsty Deckhand]]. When they finally arrives at the Thirsty Deckhand, a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal a strange mark carved at the entrance. The player may attempt an Intelligence (Arcana or History) check, but they won't find out anything, but a roll of 20 or higher will reveal that it's a part of some code system. Upon entering, they will be told by the hostess that [[Madame Laurent@ivonne-laurent]], also known as *Darling of the Docks*, will be performing tonight. If the player is sitting alone, they will be approached by [[Dalngram Ungart]], which will then start a casual conversation with the player. If they're in a party and Dalngram can't catch a moment alone with them, he will instead approach the party and inquire about them, as he hadn't seen them before in this tavern. Either way, he will warn the player or the party that he's Madame Laurent's bodyguard so they "better not bother the lass."

After a short while, if they player stays in the tavern, Madame Laurent will begin her performance on the stage. She will sing and dance seductively, getting off the stage and sauntering slowly through the crowd. At some point, Laurent will lock eyes with the player for an extended period of time, continuing her routine without breaking eye contact. When she gets close, a man in the crowd near the player will grab her arm and refuse to let go. If the player doesn't intervene, Dalngram will step over and punch the man, knocking him out. Laurent will proceed to scream, and [[Moreau@louis-jean-moreau]] will step in through the main entrance to see what happened. A drunken patron will then cry out, "TAVERN BRAWL!!!" and everyone will cheer, proceeding to fight each other in chaos.

If, instead, the player should leave the tavern before or while the show is on, they will find Moreau outside, smoking. He will comment about they player's early departure, asking if the "show isn't any good." In the middle of the conversation there will be a scream and Moreau will hurry inside, after which the tavern brawl will commence.

## The Tavern Brawl
It is pure chaos. Everyone at the tavern is either fighting or trying to avoid getting hit. Dalngram is trying to get everyone to quiet down but it's too late, they won't listen. After rolling for initiative, he will try to lead Laurent to safety behind the stage, fending off drunken patrons on the way. Moreau will follow them from a distance, expertly navigating through the crowd and dodging attacks from all directions (taking the [[Disengage]] action). Dalngram will call the player for help in escorting Laurent to safety if they're close by.

The stage is 45 feet away from Dalngram and Laurent, and they are 50 feet from the entrance. If the player is next to Moreau, he will tell them to follow him. Keeping up with him might not be an easy task, as his walking speed is 50 feet (meaning he can close the gap in one turn, taking the [[Dash]] action). Once he reaches Laurent, he will move only 15 feet at a time to match her speed in order to protect her. Moreau will not use any of his Shadow abilities at this time.

**Moving through the crowd.** The crowd counts as [[difficult terrain]]. Unless the player wants to give the brawlers a chance to hit them, they will have to take the [[Disengage]] action. Otherwise, for every 5 feet they move through the crowd, they suffer 1 (1d4 - 1) non-lethal bludgeoning damage.

**Protecting Madame Laurent.** Laurent is not a fighter. She has a walking speed of 30 feet, so she can move 15 feet each turn. For every 15 feet she moves she must succeed a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw (to which she has a +3 bonus) or  be grappled by a drunken patron.

**Breaking Grapples.** A drunken patron has 4 (1d4 + 2) health and an AC of 13. He can be knocked out nonlethally with the pummel of a weapon or with a strong unarmed strike. He will also let her go on a successful DC 13 Charisma or Strength (Intimidation) check, which requires an action.

**Playing with a party.** The entire party may try to surround Laurent as best as they can. If they can surround her from all sides, she doesn't have to make saving throws to avoid being grappled.

**Ending the Brawl.** The player can try to calm everyone down. On a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check, the brawl will end. Some patrons will mutter in dissatisfaction, but eventually everyone will return to their tables. Dalngram will start escorting Laurent backstage and she will thank the player, inviting them to come with her. Moreau will follow suit.

## Backstage Pass
Upon arriving backstage, Moreau will tend to Laurent to make sure she's okay. She will chide him, claiming that she's "not a baby," and she didn't get hurt. If the player or party had helped rescue her, she would acknowledge that as well, and thank them warmly. If the player is alone, Moreau will comment on the their performance depending on how they did. Laurent will then whisper something in Moreau's ear, and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal the words, "I have feeling about him/her."

Moreau will then inform the player or the party that what happened there is not normal. Most patrons in the Thirsty Deckhand are peaceful and, despite the name, the majority of them are not sailors. Sailors can't normally afford to drink there, and they opt for [[Grunge's Bucketfuls]]. This kind of behavior is what you would expect to see there, not here. Laurent will add that she's worried about the regulars, wondering if they'll come back after such a scene. Moreau will raise an eyebrow at that, as if something just occurred to him. A successful DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check will reveal that he might suspect that this was orchestrated somehow to achieve exactly that (averting away the regulars).

Moreau will then turn to the player (not the entire party, even if present) and ask them if they can help him with something.

# Appendix A

## The Network
The Network is a crime syndicate based in Gullenshire. It is composed of operative that gather information undercover and work to gain political leverage within the city. They don't get caught because they rarely do anything illegal, and when they do, they rely on their best operatives to do the job.

They exchange information for coin, use information to blackmail powerful individuals, and obtain information through every means you could imagine. They communicate in code, and not only most operatives don't know each other, they never quite know when they're speaking to another operative. The Network has eyes and ears everywhere, and they even use magic to spy on activity in certain places.

The Network has begun to cover more area, sending operatives to different cities in Hoverncast. The problem is that that as it expands, its operatives are spread thin. At the moment, they are looking to recruit, and every single operative is extremely valuable.

## The Thirsty Deckhand
The Thirsty Deckhand is the most luxurious tavern in Gullenshire. Upon asking for a tavern, the player will be told that they *have* to visit it at least once.

This establishment has indirect ties to the Network, since Laurent works there as a performer and a courtesan. She brings in a lot of intel from nobles and the likes and the Network works to protect the Thirsty Deckhand's reputation and traffic in order to maintain that.

## Grunge's Bucketfuls
Grunge's Bucketfuls is a cheap-looking but popular tavern amongst sailors. The prices are good and the ale is served in (clean) buckets along with enough tankards for everyone at the table. The ale isn't particularly savory but it does the job. The tavern is owned and run by [[Earnest Grunge]], or simply Earny.

This establishment is not a part of the Network, but it is home to many rumors, so it's valuable to them. Operatives generally spend their time there listening in to the word around the street, and maybe even influencing it a little.

# Appendix B

## Dalngram Ungart
[[monsters:Dalngram Ungart]] is a dwarf in charge of protecting [[Ivonne Laurent]]. He is not aware of the fact that he's working for [[the Network]], and they'd like to keep it that way.

[:monsters/dalngram-ungart:]

## Ivonne Laurent
Ivonne Laurent is a popular drow performer in the Thirsty Deckhand. She is exotic, as drows are rare in these parts. She has connections to [[Louis Jean Moreau]] and acts as one of his trusted operatives. She is known as the *Darling of the Docks*, for her beauty and charm. One of the most sought after courtesans of Gullenshire, she won't offer her services just for anyone.

[:adventures/ivonne-laurent:]

She has a very close relationship with Moreau, but the nature of it is undefined and complex. Both of them being drow elves, it is assumed that they originate from [[lore:Urk'mor]], but how and why they arrived in Hoverncast, or if they even arrived together, is unknown to anyone. The truth is that they were childhood friends, but they each arrived under different circumstances.

Ivonne was kidnapped and trafficked to Gullenshire when she was a child, where she was sold to be an escort girl. Moreau found her by chance, and by then he had risen to power in [[the Network]], and he used his leverage to free her from her abusers. She kept working independently under Moreau's protection and eventually climbed the ladder and established herself as a respected courtesan and performer.

## Louis Jean Moreau
[[monsters:Louis Jean Moreau]] is a drow elf, and the right hand of a crime syndicate called [[the Network]]. He is shrewed as he is handsome, and he is rightfully feared by all who know his name.

[:adventures/louis-jean-moreau:]

He used to be a member of the [[lore:Eyes of Dusk@urkmor]], but he decided to leave, feeling ad if they couldn't see his true potential. He left [[lore:Urk'mor]] for Hoverncast, establishing his reputation in Gullenshire. An abled and ruthless Shadow Monk, he was quickly recognized and recruited by [[the Network]]. He made his way to the top, almost, now the second hand of its mysterious leader.

He found [[Ivonne Laurent]] by chance, working as an escort lady. She was a dear childhood friend of his, until one day she went missing. He couldn't leave her at such a position, so he used his leverage to protect her from her employer. She decided to keep working as an escort, but under Moreau's protection she made a career out of it, becoming a respected courtesan, performing and dancing for a lot of coin. Moreau doesn't like to see her perform, and he'd never paid for her services. She works for him as an operative, gathering sensitive information from her clients. They still see each other from time to time as friends, as well. He'd fallen for her long ago, but due to her occupation he can't allow anything to happen between them, even if she'd be willing (which he's not sure she would be).

## Earnest Grunge
Earnest Grunge, or Earny, is a jolly dwarf with black greying hair, a few missing teeth, and a beer belly.
