This stealth-focused adventure is intended for one player and one DM, and it can start dynamically when a player arrives at [[lore:Gullenshire@hoverncast]], a small port city in [[lore:Hoverncast]]. In a campaign with more than one PC, one can be singled out by speaking to Moreau's contact in private. 

The player is free to explore the city. When asking around or looking for a tavern, they will find the Thirsty Deckhand.

When the player finally arrives at the Thirsty Deckhand, they will be told by the hostess that [[Madame Laurent@ivonne-laurent]], also known as *Darling of the Docks*, will be performing tonight. If the player is sitting alone, they will be approached by [[Dalngram Ungart]], which will then start a casual conversation with the player. If they're in a party and Dalngram can't catch a moment alone with them, he will instead approach the party and inquire them, as he hadn't seen them before in this tavern. Either way, he will warn the player or the party that he's Madame Laurent's bodyguard so they "Better not bother the lass."

# Appendix A

## Ivonne Laurent
Ivonne Laurent is a popular drow performer in the Thirsty Deckhand. She has connections to [[Louis Jean Moreau]] and acts as one of his trusted operatives. She is known as the *Darling of the Docks*, for her beauty and charm.

[:adventures/ivonne-laurent:]

She has a very close relationship with Moreau, but the nature of it is undefined and complex. Both of them being drow elves, it is assumed that they originate from [[lore:Urk'mor]], but how and why they arrived in Hoverncast, or if they even arrived together, is unknown to anyone. The truth is that they were childhood friends, but they each arrived under different circumstances.

Ivonne was kidnapped and trafficked to Gullenshire when she was a child, where she was abused and sold to prostitution. Moreau found her by chance, and by then he had risen to power in the underworld of Hoverncast, and he used his leverage to free her from her abusers. She kept working independently under Moreau's protection and eventually climbed the ladder and established herself as a respected courtesan and performer.

## Louis Jean Moreau
Louis Jean Moreau is the second hand of the head of a crime syndicate called the Network.
