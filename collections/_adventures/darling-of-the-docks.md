# Introduction 
This adventure is intended for one player and one DM, and it can start dynamically when a player arrives at [[lore:Gullenshire@hoverncast]], a small port city in [[lore:Hoverncast]]. In a campaign with more than one PC, one can be singled out by Moreau.

## Running the Adventure
Darling of the Docks is a short adventure intended for one character of 5th level. The goal of this adventure is to introduce the player to a syndicate called [[the Network]], the headquarters of which are located in Gullenshire. Gullenshire is the smallest and most prosperous port city of Hoverncast, the west coast of [[Durn]]. You can run the adventure during downtime, where one player could separate from a party without much consequence.

The player or party don't have to know that the adventure has started in order to participate in it. It is recommended to dynamically introduce characters and it's okay to go off-script. Let the player lead the adventure and lean on key-events when they feel stuck or struggle with figuring out what to do.

If there is more than one player, the characters in this adventure will focus on one of them, as if sensing great potential in them. This can serve as a personal arc for one character within the party while the rest of the players do whatever they want in the meantime, separately.

# Part 1: Enjoy the Show

The adventure begins when they player or the party arrives in the city of Gullenshire. They are free to explore the city. When asking around or looking for a tavern, they will find [[the Thirsty Deckhand]]. When they finally arrives at the Thirsty Deckhand, a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal a strange mark carved at the entrance. The player may attempt an Intelligence (Arcana or History) check, but they won't find out anything, but a roll of 20 or higher will reveal that it's a part of some code system.

> As you enter the tavern, you're struck with the poignant smell of yeast. A group of sailors are singing and waving their tankards, spilling ale and causing a racket. Some of the more noble patrons scrunch up their nose at the noise they're making, muttering in discontent. The hostess approaches you with a smile, a young dwarf with red hair and a lot of freckles on her face. "Welcome to the Thirsty Deckhand! A table for how many?" 

Upon entering, they will be told by the hostess that [[Madame Laurent@ivonne-laurent]], also known as *Darling of the Docks*, will be performing tonight. If the player is sitting alone, they will be approached by [[Dalngram Ungart]], which will then start a casual conversation with the player. If they're in a party, he will instead approach the party and inquire about them, as he hadn't seen them before in this tavern. Either way, he will warn the player or the party that he's Madame Laurent's bodyguard so they "better not bother the lass."

After a short while, if they player stays in the tavern, Madame Laurent will begin her performance on the stage. 

> Madame Laurent is a beautiful drow elf with wavy white hair, wearing a revealing white and gold dress that compliments her purple skin. She sings and dances seductively, getting off the stage and sauntering slowly through the crowd. She locks eyes with you for an extended period of time, continuing her routine without breaking eye contact.

When she gets close, a sailor in the crowd near the player will grab her arm and refuse to let go. The player may try to knock out thr sailor. He has an AC of 13 and 4 (1d4 + 2) health. If the player doesn't intervene, Dalngram will step over and punch the sailor, knocking him out. Laurent will proceed to scream, and [[Moreau@louis-jean-moreau]] will step in through the main entrance to see what happened. A drunken patron will then cry out, "TAVERN BRAWL!!!" and everyone will cheer, proceeding to fight each other.

If, instead, the player should leave the tavern before or while the show is on, they will find Moreau outside, smoking. He will comment about they player's early departure, asking if the "show isn't any good." In the middle of the conversation there will be a scream and Moreau will hurry inside, after which the tavern brawl will commence.

## The Tavern Brawl
It is pure chaos. Everyone at the tavern is either fighting or trying to avoid getting hit. Dalngram is trying to get everyone to quiet down but it's too late, they won't listen. After rolling for initiative, he will try to lead Laurent to safety behind the stage, fending off drunken patrons on the way. Moreau will follow them from a distance, expertly navigating through the crowd and dodging attacks from all directions (taking the [[Disengage]] action). Dalngram will call the player for help in escorting Laurent to safety if they're close by.

The stage is 45 feet away from Dalngram and Laurent, and they are 50 feet from the entrance. If the player is next to Moreau, he will tell them to follow him. Keeping up with him might not be an easy task, as his walking speed is 50 feet (meaning he can close the gap in one turn, taking the [[Dash]] action). Once he reaches Laurent, he will move only 15 feet at a time to match her speed in order to protect her. Moreau will not use any of his Shadow abilities at this time.

**Moving through the crowd.** The crowd counts as [[difficult terrain]]. Unless the player wants to give the brawlers a chance to hit them, they will have to take the [[Disengage]] action. Otherwise, for every 5 feet they move through the crowd, they suffer 1 (1d4 - 1) non-lethal bludgeoning damage.

**Protecting Madame Laurent.** Laurent is not a fighter. She has a walking speed of 30 feet, so she can move 15 feet each turn. For every 15 feet she moves she must succeed a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw (to which she has a +3 bonus) or  be grappled by a drunken patron.

**Breaking Grapples.** A drunken patron has 4 (1d4 + 2) health and an AC of 13. He can be knocked out nonlethally with the pummel of a weapon or with a strong unarmed strike. He will also let her go on a successful DC 13 Charisma or Strength (Intimidation) check, which requires an action.

**Playing with a party.** The entire party may try to surround Laurent as best as they can. If they can surround her from all sides, she doesn't have to make saving throws to avoid being grappled.

**Ending the Brawl.** The player can try to calm everyone down. On a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check, the brawl will end. Some patrons will mutter in dissatisfaction, but eventually everyone will return to their tables. Dalngram will start escorting Laurent backstage and she will thank the player, inviting them to come with her. Moreau will follow suit.

As the player or party advances through the crowd, they will notice the more noble patrons leaving, muttering to each other in exasperation.

## Backstage Pass
> You finally arrive backstage, successfully escorting the madame to safety. She leads you to her changing room, where you see a mirror with a small drawing stuck to the frame, of the same drow elf who just joined you in rescuing Laurent. You see clothes tossed over a changing-screen and a fine turquoise carpet on the floor.

Moreau will tend to Laurent to make sure she's okay. She will chide him, claiming that she's "not a baby," and she didn't get hurt. If the player or party had helped rescue her, she would acknowledge that as well, and thank them warmly. If the player is alone, Moreau will comment on the their performance depending on how they did. Laurent will then whisper something in Moreau's ear, and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal the words, "I have feeling about him/her."

Moreau will then inform the player or the party that what happened there is not normal. Most patrons in the Thirsty Deckhand are peaceful and, despite the name, the majority of them are not sailors. Sailors can't normally afford to drink there, and they opt for [[Grunge's Bucketfuls]]. This kind of behavior is what you would expect to see there, not here. Laurent will add that she's worried about the regulars, wondering if they'll come back after such a scene. Moreau will raise an eyebrow at that, as if something just occurred to him. A successful DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check will reveal that he might suspect that this was orchestrated somehow to achieve exactly that (averting away the regulars).

Moreau will then turn to the player (not the entire party, even if present) and ask them if they can help him with something. If the player asks why, Moreau will say that Laurent said they stood out. If the player agrees, Moreau will tell them to meet him at Grunge's Bucketfuls tomorrow at noon. Alone.

# Part 2: Maritime Intrigue
> Grunge's Bucketfuls is about as rowdy as you would expect. Sailors are dunking their tankards in buckets of ale, singing and shouting and having a great time. The wooden floor is a little sticky at certain places where ale was spilt, and the strong smell of yeast is all too present.

Should the player show up the next day at Grunge's, Moreau will only come to the meeting if the player is alone. Moreau will be in the tavern 15 minutes or so before noon, lurking in a dark corner while invisible. If the player is in a party and he will recognize any other member present in the tavern, he will discreetly walk out. Otherwise, he will approach the player and sit at their table.

## Active Listening
A waitress will approach them and ask if they'd like a bucket, but Moreau will shake his head and ask for a single tankard each. He will hand her 6 copper coins and after she leaves, he will tell the player that "that's as much as you can drink while you're on duty." He will explain that a tankard is necessary to blend in if you want to get in on the latest gossip. When the drinks arrive, he will ask the player to wander around the tavern and find out more information about the row at the Thirsty Deckhand last night, but not to ask anyone directly.

Ask the player to roll an Intelligence (Investigation) check. They will overhear bits of conversation and find out the following:

| Total | Information Revealed |
| :---: | :------------------- |
| 1-4   | Butler's entire crew went together to watch the show at the Thirsty Deckhand last night. |
| 5-9  | Butler gave his crew enough money for a few rounds of drinks. |
| 10-14 | The money wasn't from his own pocket. |
| 15-19 | He got the money from an individual who specifically stated that half of it is meant to pay for his crew to have an evening at the Thirsty Deckhand. |
| 20+   | The other half was to ensure that someone would start a brawl at the tavern. |

When the player returns to Moreau with the information they managed to gather, he will comment on their performance depending on how high they rolled. If they rolled under 10, he will say that they were too obvious, and people noticed that they were eavesdropping. If they rolled between 11-16, he will tell them that they did a great job but could be more discreet. If they rolled 17 or higher he will tell them that they were excellent. If the player rolled 20 or higher, Moreau will add that they've confirmed his suspicions.

Moreau will then tell the player that the Thirsty Deckhand is practically the political and cultural center of Gullenshire, the place where nobles come to for conversation and company. As the player has seen, conversations offer a passerby the opportunity to learn valuable information, especially when ale and wine are involved. He will tell the player that they show promise, although they have a lot to learn. If they rolled under 10 in the Intelligence (Investigation) check, Moreau will repeat the words "A lot."

After he finishes his ale, Moreau will ask the player to go for a stroll to the docks. He will fill in the blanks regarding the information the player had gathered, theorizing that someone is trying to hurt the reputation of the Thirsty Deckhand. He will tell the player that they need to find [[Timothy Butler]], captain of the Rising Tide, and interrogate him.

## Dockside Interrogation
Finding Butler won't be a difficult task, as he will be sitting alone on a chair outside his ship with a bottle of rum, singing to himself. Depending on how the player will go about the interrogation, ask them to roll a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check. The player might try to bribe Butler instead, this will also work. They will find out the following, depending on how they roll: 

| Total | Bribe | Revealed Information |
| :---: | :---: | :------------------- |
| 1-9   | -     | Someone wearing a hood and cloak came up to him and gave him 16 gold pieces, 8 of them had had to give to his crew to buy some drinks in the Thirsty Deckhand. |
| 10-17 | 1gp   | It was a woman who handed him the coin, and she wanted his crew to start a brawl at some point in the evening. |
| 18+   | 2gp   | When she handed him the coin pouch, he saw her hand. Her skin was purple, like Moreau's! |

If the player rolls lower than 18 or offers less than 2 gold pieces and feels stuck, let them roll a Wisdom (Insight) check. Regardless of the outcome, they get a sense that Butler isn't telling them everything he knows. A roll of 10 or higher will reveal that it seems like he'll talk for money. If the player will offer at least 1 gold, Butler will agree to tell them additional information about the cloaked person. He will then reveal that it was a female drow elf.

# Part 3: Unexpected Patronage
Moreau will not be in Grunge's Bucketfuls if the player goes looking for him. Whether the player will go looking for Moreau or Laurent, they will both be at the same place: in her changing room. When the player reveals what they learned from Butler, Moreau will look at Laurent in disbelief, to which she'll reply, "What are you looking at me for? It wasn't me!" A Wisdom (Insight) check of 10 or higher will reveal that she's telling the truth. Moreau will believe her as well.

Moreau will use this opportunity to tell the player about the Network (More info in [[Appendix A@the-network]]). If the player wants to join this organization, this will be the final test. Learn more about this third drow elf, find out what she wants and who she works for.

Upon investigating, the player will learn that nobody seems to have seen a third drow elf in the city. There are only two drow elves in Gullenshire, Moreau and Madame Laurent. When the player decides to wander around a tavern listening to conversations or asking around, let the player to roll another Intelligence (Investigation) check:

| Total | Information Revealed |
| :---: | :------------------- |
| 1-4   | Madame Laurent has been seen wandering around in the outskirts of town, mingling with unsavory individuals. |
| 5-9   | When she does, she wears a hooded cloak to disguise her identity. |
| 10-14 | When she visits the outskirts or the docks, it's always for a brief time, never more than an hour. |
| 15-19 | One time, she was spotted by someone in the docks while her performance in the Thirsty Deckhand was still ongoing. She must have a double or a twin. |
| 20+   | While cloaked, someone saw her change her appearance to a human. |

Should the player present Laurent and Moreau with this information, she will deny ever going to the outskirts or the docks. She'll claim that she spends most of her time in her quarters or in the Thirsty Deckhand. She will deny having a double or a twin (Moreau will back her up, saying that she's an only child), and if asked about changing her appearance to a human, she will deny having the ability to do so. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check will reveal that she's being truthful. 

## Looking for the Lookalike
When presented with the information about changing her appearance, she will conclude that the culprit is probably [[Aulette Huddleborne]]. Otherwise, Moreau will conclude that someone who looks like her is going around and damaging her reputation.

Either way, Moreau will tell the player to go to the outskirts and wait for her lookalike to show up. If the player would hang around in the outskirts in the evening, they will spot the lookalike. She has a passive perception of 13, which the player will need to beat with a Dexterity (Stealth) check if they plan to remain unseen by her. If she sees the player, she will recognize them and start making a run for it.

## Chasing the Cheater
The lookalike will try to hide around the corner in some alley and change shape to her original form. The player will need to catch her before that.

[Chase Mechanics]

## Confronting the Counterfeiter
Regardless of what happens, Moreau will come out of the shadows having seen the lookalike transform back, saying, "Well, well, well. Aulette Huddleborne". She will have nowhere to run.

# Appendix A

## The Network
The Network is a syndicate based in Gullenshire. It is composed of operatives that gather information undercover and work to gain political leverage within the city. They don't get caught because they rarely do anything illegal, and when they do, they rely on their best operatives to do the job.

They exchange information for coin, use information to blackmail powerful individuals, and obtain information through every means you could imagine. They communicate in code, and most operatives don't know each other. The Network has eyes and ears everywhere, and they even use magic to spy on activity in certain places.

The Network has begun to cover more area, sending operatives to different cities in Hoverncast. The problem is that that as it expands, its operatives are spread thin. At the moment, they are looking to recruit, and every single operative is extremely valuable.

## The Thirsty Deckhand
The Thirsty Deckhand is the most luxurious tavern in Gullenshire. Upon asking for a tavern, the player will be told that they *have* to visit it at least once.

This establishment has indirect ties to the Network, since Laurent works there as a performer and a courtesan. She brings in a lot of intel from nobles and the likes and the Network works to protect the Thirsty Deckhand's reputation and traffic in order to maintain that.

## Grunge's Bucketfuls
Grunge's Bucketfuls is a cheap-looking but popular tavern amongst sailors. The prices are good and the ale is served in (clean) buckets along with enough tankards for everyone at the table. The ale isn't particularly savory but it does the job. The tavern is owned and run by [[Earnest Grunge]], or simply Earny.

This establishment is not a part of the Network, but it is home to many rumors, so it's valuable to them. Operatives generally spend their time there listening in to the word around the street, and maybe even influencing it a little.

# Appendix B

## Dalngram Ungart
[[monsters:Dalngram Ungart]] is a dwarf in charge of protecting [[Ivonne Laurent]]. He is not aware of the fact that he's working for [[the Network]], and they'd like to keep it that way.

[:monsters/dalngram-ungart:]

## Ivonne Laurent
Ivonne Laurent is a popular drow performer in the Thirsty Deckhand. She is exotic, as drows are rare in these parts. She has connections to [[Louis Jean Moreau]] and acts as one of his trusted operatives. She is known as the *Darling of the Docks*, for her beauty and charm. One of the most sought after courtesans of Gullenshire, she won't offer her services just for anyone.

[:adventures/ivonne-laurent:]

She has a very close relationship with Moreau, but the nature of it is undefined and complex. Both of them being drow elves, it is assumed that they originate from [[lore:Urk'mor]], but how and why they arrived in Hoverncast, or if they even arrived together, is unknown to anyone. The truth is that they were childhood friends, but they each arrived under different circumstances.

Ivonne was kidnapped and trafficked to Gullenshire when she was a child, where she was sold to be an escort girl. Moreau found her by chance, and by then he had risen to power in [[the Network]], and he used his leverage to free her from her abusers. She kept working independently under Moreau's protection and eventually climbed the ladder and established herself as a respected courtesan and performer.

## Louis Jean Moreau
[[monsters:Louis Jean Moreau]] is a drow elf, and the right hand of a crime syndicate called [[the Network]]. He is shrewed as he is handsome, and he is rightfully feared by all who know his name.

[:adventures/louis-jean-moreau:]

He used to be a member of the [[lore:Eyes of Dusk@urkmor]], but he decided to leave, feeling as if they couldn't see his true potential. He left [[lore:Urk'mor]] for Hoverncast, establishing his reputation in Gullenshire. An abled and ruthless Shadow Monk, he was quickly recognized and recruited by [[the Network]]. He made his way to the top, almost, now the second hand of its mysterious leader.

He found [[Ivonne Laurent]] by chance, working as an escort lady. She was a dear childhood friend of his, until one day she went missing. He couldn't leave her at such a position, so he used his leverage to protect her from her employer. She decided to keep working as an escort, but under Moreau's protection she made a career out of it, becoming a respected courtesan, performing and dancing for a lot of coin. Moreau doesn't like to see her perform, and he'd never paid for her services. She works for him as an operative, gathering sensitive information from her clients. They still see each other from time to time as friends, as well. He'd fallen for her long ago, but due to her occupation he can't allow anything to happen between them, even if she'd be willing (which he's not sure she would be).

## Earnest Grunge
Earnest Grunge, or Earny, is a jolly dwarf with black greying hair, a few missing teeth, and a beer belly.

## Aulette Huddleborne
[[monsters:Aulette Huddleborne]] is a proud human bard performing in the Hungry Kraken. Using the [[Disguise Self]] spell, she makes herself look like Madame Laurent, dealing in shady business and trying to hurt her reputation. She's a competitor, jealous of her success.
