This stealth-focused adventure is intended for one player and one DM, and it can start dynamically when a player arrives at [[lore:Gullenshire@hoverncast]], a small port city in [[lore:Hoverncast]]. In a campaign with more than one PC, one can be singled out by speaking to Moreau's contact in private. 

The player is free to explore the city. When asking around or looking for a tavern, they will find the Thirsty Deckhand.

When the player finally arrives at the Thirsty Deckhand, they will be told by the hostess that [[Madame Laurent@ivonne-laurent]], also known as *Darling of the Docks*, will be performing tonight. If the player is sitting alone, they will be approached by [[Dalngram Ungart]], which will then start a casual conversation with the player. If they're in a party and Dalngram can't catch a moment alone with them, he will instead approach the party and inquire them, as he hadn't seen them before in this tavern. Either way, he will warn the player or the party that he's Madame Laurent's bodyguard so they "Better not bother the lass."

She has a very close relationship with Moreau, but the nature of it is undefined. Both of them being drow elves, it is assumed that they originate from [[Urk'mor]], but how and why they arrived in Hoverncast is unknown.
