This stealth-focused adventure is intended for one player and one DM. In a campaign with more than one PC, one can be singled out by speaking to Moreau's contact in private. The adventure begins in the outskirts of [[lore:Gullenshire@hoverncast]], a small port city in [[Hoverncast]].

When the player finally arrives at the Thirsty Deckhand, they will be told by the hostess that Madame (Ivonne) Laurent, also known as the Darling of the Docks, will be performing tonight.
