# Introduction 
This stealth-focused adventure is intended for one player and one DM, and it can start dynamically when a player arrives at [[lore:Gullenshire@hoverncast]], a small port city in [[lore:Hoverncast]]. In a campaign with more than one PC, one can be singled out by speaking to Moreau's contact in private.

## Running the Adventure
Darling of the Docks is a short adventure intended for one character of 5th level. The goal of this adventure is to introduce the player to a crime syndicate called [[the Network]], the headquarters of which are located in Gullenshire. Gullenshire is the smallest and most prosperous port city of Hoverncast, the west coast of [[Durn]].

The player or party don't have to know that the adventure has started in order to participate

# Part 1: Madame Laurent

The adventure begins when they player or the party arrives in the city of Gullenshire. They are free to explore the city. When asking around or looking for a tavern, they will find [[the Thirsty Deckhand]]. When they finally arrives at the Thirsty Deckhand, they will be told by the hostess that [[Madame Laurent@ivonne-laurent]], also known as *Darling of the Docks*, will be performing tonight. If the player is sitting alone, they will be approached by [[Dalngram Ungart]], which will then start a casual conversation with the player. If they're in a party and Dalngram can't catch a moment alone with them, he will instead approach the party and inquire about them, as he hadn't seen them before in this tavern. Either way, he will warn the player or the party that he's Madame Laurent's bodyguard so they "better not bother the lass."

After a short while, if they player stays in the tavern, Madame Laurent will begin her performance on the stage. She will sing and dance seductively, getting off the stage and sauntering slowly through the crowd.

# Appendix A

## The Network
The Network is a crime syndicate based in Gullenshire. It is composed of operative that gather information undercover and work to gain political leverage within the city. They don't get caught because they rarely do anything illegal, and when they do, they rely on their best operatives to do the job.

They exchange information for coin, use information to blackmail powerful individuals, and obtain information through every means you could imagine. They communicate in code, and not only most operatives don't know each other, they never quite know when they're speaking to another operative. The Network has eyes and ears everywhere, and they even use magic to spy on activity in certain places.

## The Thirsty Deckhand
The Thirsty Deckhand is the most luxurious tavern in Gullenshire. Upon asking for a tavern, the player will be told that they *have* to visit it at least once.

# Appendix B

## Dalngram Ungart
[[monsters:Dalngram Ungart]] is a dwarf in charge of protecting [[Ivonne Laurent]]. He is not aware of the fact that he's working for [[the Network]], and they'd like to keep it that way.

## Ivonne Laurent
Ivonne Laurent is a popular drow performer in the Thirsty Deckhand. She has connections to [[Louis Jean Moreau]] and acts as one of his trusted operatives. She is known as the *Darling of the Docks*, for her beauty and charm. One of the most sought after courtesans of Gullenshire, she won't offer her services just for anyone.

[:adventures/ivonne-laurent:]

She has a very close relationship with Moreau, but the nature of it is undefined and complex. Both of them being drow elves, it is assumed that they originate from [[lore:Urk'mor]], but how and why they arrived in Hoverncast, or if they even arrived together, is unknown to anyone. The truth is that they were childhood friends, but they each arrived under different circumstances.

Ivonne was kidnapped and trafficked to Gullenshire when she was a child, where she was sold to be an escort girl. Moreau found her by chance, and by then he had risen to power in [[the Network]], and he used his leverage to free her from her abusers. She kept working independently under Moreau's protection and eventually climbed the ladder and established herself as a respected courtesan and performer.

## Louis Jean Moreau
[[monsters:Louis Jean Moreau]] is the second hand of a crime syndicate called the Network. He is shrewed as he is handsome, and he is rightfully feared by all who know his name.

[:adventures/louis-jean-moreau:]

He used to be a member of the [[lore:Eyes of Dusk@urkmor]], but he decided to leave, feeling ad if they couldn't see his true potential. He left [[lore:Urk'mor]] for Hoverncast, establishing his reputation in Gullenshire. An abled and ruthless Shadow Monk, he was quickly recognized and recruited by [[the Network]]. He made his way to the top, almost, now the second hand of its mysterious leader.

He found [[Ivonne Laurent]] by chance, working as an escort lady. She was a dear childhood friend of his, until one day she went missing. He couldn't leave her at such a position, so he used his leverage to protect her from her employer. She decided to keep working as an escort, but under Moreau's protection she made a career out of it, becoming a respected courtesan, performing and dancing for a lot of coin. Moreau doesn't like to see her perform, and he'd never paid for her services. She works for him as an operative, gathering sensitive information from her clients. They still see each other from time to time as friends, as well. He'd fallen for her long ago, but due to her occupation he can't allow anything to happen between them, even if she'd be willing (which he's not sure she would be).
