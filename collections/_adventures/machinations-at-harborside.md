# Introduction
This adventure is intended for one player and one DM, and it can start dynamically after a player is introduced to [[the Harborside Conspiracy]]. In a campaign with more than one PC, one can separate from the party and complete the adventure during downtime.

## Running the Adventure
Machinations at Harborside is a short adventure intended for one character of 5th level or higher. This adventure revolves around a syndicate called the Harborside Conspiracy, the headquarters of which are located in Gullenshire. Gullenshire is the smallest and most prosperous port city of Hoverncast, the west coast of Durn. You can run the adventure during downtime, where one player could separate from a party without much consequence.

# Part 1: A Nightly Cruise
The adventure begins when a player enters a tavern in Gullenshire. When their drink arrives, a folded note will be stuck under the bottom of the glass. If the player doesn't order a drink, they will get an ale on the house. The note reads:

> Your presence is requested at harborside tonight after dusk. Please arrive unarmed and make sure you are not accompanied by anyone. A boat will await you at the last platform. Bring this note with you.

If the player doesn't realize this note is from the Harborside Conspiracy, ask them to make a DC 10 Intelligence check. On success, they will deduct this from the phrasing. As the player makes their way to the docks, ask them to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to make sure they're not being followed.

> No one seems to follow you as you make your way to the docks, maintaining a casual manner. As it's starting to get dark, the sunset slowly fades away and the stars begin to appear in the sky. The docks are lit by lanterns along the way and the wood creaks under your step as you reach the last platform, where a small boat is indeed waiting for you. In the boat you see a small individual whose face you can't make out from this distance. There's room for exactly one more person on the boat.

When the player approaches the boat, they will be greeted by a halfling named Renus. He will be wearing dark clothes
