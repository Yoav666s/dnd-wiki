# Introduction
This adventure is intended for one player and one DM, and it can start dynamically after a player is introduced to [[the Harborside Conspiracy]]. In a campaign with more than one PC, one can separate from the party and complete the adventure during downtime.

## Running the Adventure
Machinations at Harborside is a short adventure intended for one character of 5th level or higher. This adventure revolves around a syndicate called the Harborside Conspiracy, the headquarters of which are located in Gullenshire. Gullenshire is the smallest and most prosperous port city of Hoverncast, the west coast of [[Durn]]. You can run the adventure during downtime, where one player could separate from a party without much consequence.

# Part 1: Nightly Cruise
The adventure begins when a player enters a tavern in Gullenshire. When their drink arrives, a folded note will be stuck under the bottom of the glass. If the player doesn't order a drink, they will get an ale on the house. The note reads:

> Your presence is requested at harborside tonight after dusk. Please arrive unarmed and make sure you are not accompanied by anyone. A boat will await you at the last platform. Burn after reading.
