# Introduction
This adventure takes place in the royal court of Corodill, the capital of Thortmere, and by the end of this adventure the party could potentially gain access to the [[Tome of Fey Secrets]], a cursed book full of forbidden spells that slowly drives its owner insane. This book contains spells that trifle with the subject's mind, as listed in [[Appendix B]].

## Running the Adventure
Signs of Madness is a short adventure intended for a party of 3-5 players of 4th to 5th level. This adventure assumes the PCs are passing through the royal court of Corodill in Thortmere, but it can take place in any royal court. If you do decide to run this adventure in a different setting or a different place, some NPCs introduced in this adventure may or may not be relevant to you. You may modify existing or use different NPCs to run this adventure.

# Part 1: An Unjustified Execution
In the past few months, numerous the people of the court of Sun Rock Castle have been executed for treason. One of them was lord [[Oderus Fritston]], a beloved member of the court who was allegedly conspiring against the king. His wife Minara still can't believe that it's true. She refuses to believe that her husband, the man she knew and loved, would do such a terribly stupid thing. It wasn't just that she missed him, the idea of him conspiring against the king is outright preposterous to her. Of course, she accepted the king's decision to execute her husband and didn't confront him about it. That would be suicide. But she is determined to get to the root of this and find out what had actually happened.

> "I had never seem him like this. He was so sure that the king was after him for some reason and he told me that the only way to get out of this was to escape the castle. I don't know what had got into him, but it wasn't the Oderus I knew. He didn't tell me the real reason he thought he was under investigation, only these signs; like, the way that the king looked at him, masked threats within the documents he received, coded messages he overheard around the court. He was completely paranoid. Delusional, even. He told me he noticed a pattern in recent executions. Courtiers acting paranoid all of a sudden prompting investigations and interrogations. Very little evidence, if at all. Strange confessions that seemed out of character. It's the same thing that happened to him."

# Appendix A

## Mirtenville
Mirtenville is a small village near Harkstone around the center of Thortmere. It's snowy in the winter and still a bit rainy in the summer, creating a nurturing ground for crops most of the year.

## Jasper Middlewood
Jasper is the spymaster's assistant in the court of Sun Rock Castle. He is a strange individual who seems constantly on edge, always muttering to himself and getting lost in thought, but he's useful to king Krad. He is a fey sorcerer by trade, his magical powers originate from a secret interaction with the fey in his early life. When he was younger, he was romantically involved with a wood faery called Sypharia from a forest near Mirtenville, the village in which he grew up. She tricked him into saying that his heart belongs to her and her only, and then she disappeared. Shortly thereafter, he found that he could manifest magic when he thought of her. His eyes would well up with silvery tears of longing and he could affect simple spells. As his heartache grew more and more unbearable, his powers became stronger.

Word has begun to spread: the son of a farmer had somehow acquired sorcerous powers. Nobody knew how--Jasper refused to tell the full story; he still yearned for Sypharia, missing her presence and grace. The king's spymaster dispatched a carriage to Mirtenville. A sorcerer from a common bloodline was rare--and dangerous. He was brought in for questioning disguised as a feast in his honor. During the feast he was subtly interrogated by the spymaster, the king and his advisor, the court wizard, the high cleric who casted [[zone of truth]], and the captain of the royal guard. They wanted to find out how he got his powers, whether or not he was a threat, and if he could be useful to them. He revealed that his powers come from the feywild but remained evasive around the topic of Sypharia. After the meal he was offered a room for the night. The king and his court had decided that it's best to keep him close, so they offered him a position as the spymaster's assistant.

One night at the court garden, Sypharia returned with a gift, a magical tome (See [[Tome of Fey Secrets]]) from somewhere in the feywild. She refused to say how and where she got it, but she wanted Jasper to keep it for her until she returned to take it back. They kissed and she disappeared again, without a trace. Jasper spent a lot of time with the book. It was in Sylvan, which he learned to speak and read from the time he spent with Sypharia. Over time, he discovered the secrets hidden within the tome and learned the strange spells it has to offer. He didn't realize how it slowly started driving him insane.

Ever since, he's been secretly using spells from the tome in order to subtly sow confusion and chaos in the court. The tome has been telling him things, feeding him tales of his greatness, causing him to mistrust his superiors, and encouraging him to infect others with madness. Using metamagic, he'd subtly cast spells like [[detect thoughts]] in order to find out what other courtiers are thinking, then he would cast [[notion]] or [[intrude thoughts]] to try and plant strange ideas in their minds. On his ostensible path to the top, whenever he'd like to get rid of or neutralize another courtier, he'd use [[delusion]] to cause him or her to believe that the crown is investigating them due to suspicion of treason. They would start acting suspicious, trying too hard to prove their innocence and loyalty. Then the king would actually grow suspicious of them which would result in a real investigation. Regardless of whether the king had found anything to convict the courtier, they would lose favor and be subjected to torture. The interrogation would always end in a confession of some sort, sincere or otherwise, and an execution would follow.

## Oderus Fritston
Lord Oderus Fritston was the court auditor in Sun Rock Castle. He was the person who ensured that the crown's laws and procedures are exercised properly and cleanly. He didn't initiate arrests or inquiries, but examined completed investigations for procedural irregularities. This had made him a threat to Jasper, as he started noticing a pattern in the recent executions: the subjects started acting paranoid for no apparent reason, there was very little physical evidence if at all, and the confessions didn't make sense. Jasper had learned this through the [[detect thoughts]] spell, before Oderus had the chance to talk to anyone about it. He then casted [[delusion]] on him and made him believe that the king has already started investigating him as well, and he is convinced that Oderus is conspiring against him. Without realizing that he's repeating the pattern that he'd just figured out, he started compulsively searching for hidden signs that he's being investigated in the documents he received, the way the king talked to and looked at him, and parts of overheard conversations around the court.

Oderus knew that the investigation could only end in one way, so he decided to try and make an escape. He told his wife, Minara, that it's not safe for him at the court anymore and they have to leave. She refused to come with him without an explanation, so he told her that the king is convinced that Oderus is conspiring against him and has started an investigation. She asked how does he know that he's being investigated and how does he know what the king is thinking, and he listed the many signs he noticed that confirm his suspicions. He told her that these investigations always end in torture and an execution, and that he has to leave the court before that happens. He didn't want to endanger Minara so he told her to meet him the next morning at Mince & Hops tavern, where he had trusted friends who would let him hide there. Unfortunately, he got caught when he tried to exit the castle in the middle of the night, and an interrogation ensued. He was executed the next morning.
