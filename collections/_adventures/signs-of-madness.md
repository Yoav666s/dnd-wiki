# Introduction
This adventure can take place in any village or settlement, and at the end of this adventure the party will potentially gain access to the [[Tome of Fey Secrets]], a cursed book full of forbidden spells that slowly drives its owner insane. This book contains spells that trifle with the subject's mind, as [[listed in Appendix B]].

## Running the Adventure
Signs of Madness is a short adventure intended for a party of 3-5 players of 3rd to 5th level. This adventure assumes the PCs are passing through the village of Mirtenville in Thortmere, but it can take place in any village or settlement.
