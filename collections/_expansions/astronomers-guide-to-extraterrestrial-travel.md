# Introduction: Astronomy and the Universe Beyond
Astronomy is the study of celestial bodies, space, and everything beyond planet Terrus. It concerns itself not only with stars, moons, and planets, but also with the invisible forces that bind them together. It is a science that explores gravity, light, the vacuum of space, and the vast galaxy that lies beyond man's grasp. Taking advantage of gnomish inventions and clever use of magic, it studies other planets and aims to make them habitable.

## Observation of Moons and Other Planets
Moons and other planets have been observed using a revolutionary invention called the [[magniscope]], a large enchanted telescope which allows the operator to cast [[Scrying]] on the location it is focused on. This has allowed astronomers to see the surfaces of Selene (Terrus's moon) and of other planets in the Ausarian Expanse.
