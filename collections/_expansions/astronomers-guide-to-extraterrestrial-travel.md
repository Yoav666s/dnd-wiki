# Introduction: Astronomy and the Universe Beyond
Astronomy is the study of celestial bodies, space, and everything beyond planet Terrus. It concerns itself not only with stars, moons, and planets, but also with the invisible forces that bind them together. It is a science that explores gravity, light, the vacuum of space, and the vast galaxy that lies beyond the Ausarian Expanse. Taking advantage of gnomish inventions and clever use of magic, it studies other planets and aims to make them habitable.

## The Ausarian Expanse
The Ausarian Expanse is a solar system in which Terrus is the fifth planet from Ausaria, the sun. It has one moon called Selene, and it otherwise resembles Earth as we know it. The fourth and sixth planets are also believed to be habitable, but their atmospheres are different from Terrus's and thus creatures from Terrus are not adapted to breathe there.

### Igneus
**The first planet from Ausaria.** It is completely uninhabitable. It is tidally locked, meaning that one side is always facing the sun while the other remains in darkness. The dark side consists of mountains of black rock, while the other side harbors oceans of magma with ever changing continents that clash against each other, forming and crumbling mountains and valleys. Moreover, the atmosphere of Igneus is toxic, consisting of a high percentage of sulfur, which results in a hazy yellow sky.

### Rosea
**The second planet from Ausaria.** It's a pink gas giant with four moons orbiting it.

### Nodus
**The third planet from Ausaria.** It's a comparatively tiny bundle of asteroids that crushed together to form a dwarf planet.

### Albaxia
**The fourth planet from Ausaria.** It seems blue from space, and is considered a habitable planet. From its surface, the sunlight has a pink, reddish hue to it, as a result of the thick and hazy atmosphere's blue tint which filters out much of the shorter-wavelength light. Shadows have a warm, amber tone, and the plants and foliage are mostly red, purple, and black in color.

The atmosphere there is breathable for terrestrial creatures without requiring much adaptation as it consists of Neon (\~49%), Oxygen (\~21%), Krypton (\~26%), and Methane (\~2-3%), as well as vapors and dust. Methane causes the blue tint, but is also highly flammable. As a result, flames are more volatile and unpredictable.

**Moons.** Albaxia has two moons, called Orbis Major and Orbis Minor. Orbis Major is the bigger one, but it's further from Albaxia than Orbis Minor, which is considerably smaller. It's quite easy to discern between them by their size and speed. Orbis Major conpletes a full orbit

#### The Albaxian Day
One day on Albaxia is approximately 147 hours, or just over 6 days on Terrus. This results in very hot afternoons and very cold nights, as the sun shines or is absent for over 70 hours each time. The day is divided to twelve 12.25-hour periods by terrestrial creatures, who are used to 24 hour days.

**Morning.** The morning is equivalent to a normal day on Terrus in temperature and weather. The first hours of light are still cool and comfortable from the early morning, and it starts getting hot after about six hours.

**Noon.** The noon is hot, and it's usually a good time to find cover and rest. It is not recommended to sleep in the sun, even though the thick atmosphere provides some protection from ultraviolet radiation.

**Midday.** The midday is the hottest period of the day, especially towards the end. It is recommended to stay hydrated and remain under cover as much as possible.

**Afternoon.** During the late afternoon hours the heat starts to subside. It's a good time to find cover and rest.

**Twilight.** During twilight, the sky has beautiful shades of pink and orange, and cooler breeze starts to blow. It is similar to the morning in terms of temperature and weather.

**Evening.** The evening is when it starts getting colder, and towards the end the sun begins to set, resulting in a marvelous near 20-minute sunset. It's a good time to take a rest.

**Mornight.** The mornight is the first dark morning. It's still warm outside due to the thick atmosphere that traps the heat and prevents the planet from freezing.

**Night.** The first night is cold, but not freezing. It's a good time to take a rest.

**Midnight.** The midnight is the second dark morning. It's the coldest period of the Albaxian day, reaching a temperature of around 7-10°C in summer and 0-6°C in winter.

**Afternight.** The afternight, or second night, is initially very cold, but it gets warmer towards the end. It's a good time to take a rest.

**Dawn.** The dawn is when you can see first hints of light. It's beginning to be cool and comfortable outside. By the end of it, the sun rises in a marvelous near 20-minute sunrise.

**Early Morning.** The early morning is still cool and comfortable from the night before, and is a great time to take a rest.

Some prefer to wake up in the early morning, taking rests at the same \~12.5 hour intervals. It doesn't matter since the day is so long, and you have to sleep during daytime and stay awake during nighttime, anyway.

### Terrus 
**The fifth planet from Ausaria.** It consists of vast continents, large bodies of water, plants, and an atmosphere composition that's perfect for terrestrial life. It is home for countless civilizations that live in forests, jungles, deserts, and other biomes, and most adventures take place there.

**Moons.** Terrus has one moon, called Selene.

## Observation of Moons and Other Planets
Moons and other planets have been observed using a revolutionary invention called the [[magniscope]], a large enchanted telescope which allows the operator to cast [[Scrying]] on the location it is focused on. This has allowed astronomers to see the surface of Selene and of other planets in the Ausarian Expanse.
