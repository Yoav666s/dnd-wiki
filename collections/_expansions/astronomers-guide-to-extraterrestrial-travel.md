# Introduction: Astronomy and the Universe Beyond
Astronomy is the study of celestial bodies, space, and everything beyond planet Terrus. It concerns itself not only with stars, moons, and planets, but also with the invisible forces that bind them together. It is a science that explores gravity, light, the vacuum of space, and the vast galaxy that lies beyond the Ausarian Expanse. Taking advantage of gnomish inventions and clever use of magic, it studies other planets and aims to make them habitable.

## The Ausarian Expanse
The Ausarian Expanse is a solar system in which Terrus is the fifth planet from Ausaria, the sun. It has one moon called Selene, and it otherwise resembles Earth as we know it. The fourth and sixth planets are also believed to be habitable, but their atmospheres are different from Terrus's and thus creatures from Terrus are not adapted to breathe there.

### Igneus
**The first planet from Ausaria.** It's made from black rock and molten magma and is completely inhabitable. It is believed that devils could possibly survive there if they had air to breathe.

### Rosea
**The second planet from Ausaria.** It's a pink gas giant with four moons orbiting it.

### Nodus
**The third planet from Ausaria.** It's a comparatively tiny bundle of asteroids that crushed together to form a dwarf planet.

### Albaxia
**The fourth planet from Ausaria.** It seems blue from space, and is considered a habitable planet. From its surface, the sunlight has a pink, reddish hue to it, as a result of the thick and hazy atmosphere's blue tint which filters out much of the shorter-wavelength light. Shadows have a warm, amber tone, and the plants and foliage are mostly red, purple, and black in color.

The atmosphere there is breathable for terrestrial creatures without requiring much adaptation as it consists of Neon (\~49%), Oxygen (\~21%), Krypton (\~26%), and Methane (\~2-3%), as well as vapors and dust. Methane causes the blue tint, but is also highly flammable. As a result, flames are more volatile and unpredictable.

### Terrus 
**The fifth planet from Ausaria.** It consists of vast continents, large bodies of water, plants, and an atmosphere composition that's perfect for terrestrial life. It is home for forests, jungles, deserts, and other biomes, and most adventures take place there.

## Observation of Moons and Other Planets
Moons and other planets have been observed using a revolutionary invention called the [[magniscope]], a large enchanted telescope which allows the operator to cast [[Scrying]] on the location it is focused on. This has allowed astronomers to see the surface of Selene and of other planets in the Ausarian Expanse.
