# Introduction: Astronomy and the Universe Beyond
Astronomy is the study of celestial bodies, space, and everything beyond planet Terrus. It concerns itself not only with stars, moons, and planets, but also with the invisible forces that bind them together. It is a science that explores gravity, light, the vacuum of space, and the vast galaxy that lies beyond the Ausarian Expanse. Taking advantage of gnomish inventions and clever use of magic, it studies other planets and aims to make them habitable.

## The Ausarian Expanse
The Ausarian Expanse is a solar system in which Terrus is the fifth planet from Ausaria, the sun. It has one moon called Selene, and it otherwise resembles Earth as we know it.

### Igneus
**The first planet from Ausaria.** It is completely uninhabitable. It is tidally locked, meaning that one side is always facing the sun while the other remains in darkness. The dark side consists of mountains of black rock, while the other side harbors oceans of magma with ever changing continents that clash against each other, forming and crumbling mountains and valleys. Moreover, the atmosphere of Igneus is toxic, consisting of a high percentage of sulfur, which results in a hazy yellow sky.

### Rosea
**The second planet from Ausaria.** It's a pink gas giant with four moons orbiting it.

### Nodus
**The third planet from Ausaria.** It's a comparatively tiny bundle of asteroids that crushed together to form a dwarf planet.

### Albaxia
**The fourth planet from Ausaria.** It seems blue from space, and is considered a habitable planet. From its surface, the sunlight has a pink, reddish hue to it, as a result of the thick and hazy atmosphere's blue tint which filters out much of the shorter-wavelength light. Shadows have a warm, amber tone, and the plants and foliage are mostly red, purple, and black in color. Albaxia completes an orbit around Ausaria every 104.5 Albaxian days (or approximately 640 Terrestrial days).

[:extraterrestrial/planets/albaxia:]

**Atmosphere.** The atmosphere on Albaxia consists of Neon (\~56%), Oxygen (\~14%), Krypton (\~26%), and Methane (\~2-3%, in the upper layers), as well as vapors and dust. The atmospheric pressure is higher than on Terrus, so even though the percentage of Oxygen is lower, the air is still breathable for terrestrial creatures.

**Methane.** Methane causes the blue tint, but is also highly flammable. As a result, flames are more volatile and unpredictable, but are generally safe because Methane tends to concentrate at the higher layers where oxygen is low.

**Krypton.** Krypton is a potent anesthetic. Upon arriving on Albaxia, terrestrial creatures would feel a wave of euphoria and giddiness, finding things much funnier than they actually are. This lasts for the first 48-96 hours on Albaxia. Mental abilities slow down as well, and dexterity is hindered, causing a lack of coordination similar to alcohol intoxication. After at least a month of exposure to the Albaxian atmosphere, terrestrial creatures grow complacent. Their short-term memory is impaired, and some become paranoid.

**Sound.** Because of the high concentration of Krypton in the air, creatures' voices would sound significantly deeper than they are on Terrus. Whispers, footsteps, and the rustle of leaves can be heard from greater distances, while high pitched noises are muffled. Sound travels more slowly on Albaxia, meaning there would be a slight delay over distances greater than 60 feet.

**Methanol.** The primary liquid on Albaxia is Methanol, which is highly flammable. When burns, it produces Carbon Dioxide and water, and its flame is blue and barely visible in the daylight. There aren't any seas or lakes as the methanol quickly sinks into the ground, but there are puddles and rivers when it rains. It's not uncommon to encounter burning puddles, which are highly dangerous.

**Ground.** The ground is made of Limestone which releases Carbon Dioxide when heated, immediately extinguishing any Methanol flames that might arise.

**Moons.** Albaxia has two moons, called Orbis Major and Orbis Minor. Orbis Major is the bigger one, but it's further from Albaxia than Orbis Minor, which is considerably smaller. It's quite easy to discern between them by their size and speed. Orbis Major conpletes a full orbit every seven Albaxian days (almost 43 Terrestrial days), while Orbis Minor completes one orbit every 2.3 Albaxian days (approximately one fortnight on Terrus).

#### The Albaxian Day
One day on Albaxia is approximately 147 hours, or just over 6 days on Terrus. This results in very hot afternoons and very cold nights, as the sun shines or is absent for over 70 hours at a time. The day is divided to twelve 12.25-hour periods by terrestrial creatures, who are used to 24-hour days.

**Morning.** The morning is equivalent to a normal day on Terrus in temperature and weather. The first hours of light are still cool and comfortable from the early morning, and it starts getting hot after about six hours.

**Noon.** The noon is hot, and it's usually a good time to find cover and rest. It is not recommended to sleep in the sun, even though the thick atmosphere provides some protection from ultraviolet radiation.

**Midday.** The midday is the hottest period of the day, especially towards the end. It is recommended to stay hydrated and remain under cover as much as possible.

**Afternoon.** During the late afternoon hours the heat starts to subside. It's a good time to find cover and rest.

**Twilight.** During twilight, the sky has beautiful shades of pink and orange, and cooler breeze starts to blow. It is similar to the morning in terms of temperature and weather.

**Evening.** The evening is when it starts getting colder, and towards the end the sun begins to set, resulting in a marvelous near 20-minute sunset. It's a good time to take a rest.

**Mornight.** The mornight is the first dark morning. It's still warm outside due to the thick atmosphere that traps the heat and prevents the planet from freezing.

**Night.** The first night is cold, but not freezing. It's a good time to take a rest.

**Midnight.** The midnight is the second dark morning. It's the coldest period of the Albaxian day, reaching a temperature of around 7-10°C in summer and 0-6°C in winter.

**Afternight.** The afternight, or second night, is initially very cold, but it gets warmer towards the end. It's a good time to take a rest.

**Dawn.** The dawn is when you can see first hints of light. It's beginning to be cool and comfortable outside. By the end of it, the sun rises in a marvelous near 20-minute sunrise.

**Early Morning.** The early morning is still cool and comfortable from the night before, and is a great time to take a rest.

Some prefer to wake up in the early morning, taking rests at the same \~12.5 hour intervals. It doesn't matter since the day is so long, and you have to sleep during daytime and stay awake during nighttime, anyway.

### Terrus 
**The fifth planet from Ausaria.** It consists of vast continents, large bodies of water, plants, and an atmosphere composition that's perfect for terrestrial life. It is home for countless civilizations that live in forests, jungles, deserts, and other biomes, and most adventures take place there. Terrus completes an orbit around Ausaria approximately every 950 days. One day on Terrus is approximately 24 hours.

**Moons.** Terrus has one moon, called Selene. It conpletes a full orbit approximately every 19.75 days.

**The Terrestrial Calendar.** Since a "year" on Terrus takes 950 days, people don't tend to measure years by the time it takes Terrus to orbit the sun. Instead, they measure the passage of time by the time it takes Selene to orbit Terrus. They divide the year to 3 19-day and nine 20-day months, resulting in a 237-day year. The summer year is 2 days longer, having only one 19-day month.

**Seasons.** The seasons on Terrus are long, each taking approximately a year. Summers yield plentiful harvest, resulting in 3 full rotations of crops, which are necessary to hoard for the long winters.

### Ghelus
**The sixth planet from Ausaria.** It is composed of brown rock, orange soil, and is completely frozen (\~-112°C). It has lakes, rivers, and seas of liquid Ethane. Ghelus completes an orbit around Ausaria every 2,095 terrestrial days.

**Atmosphere.** Ghelus's atmosphere is composed of Argon (\~82%), Carbon Tetrafluoride (\~15%), Carbon Monoxide (\~2%), and Ethane vapor (<1%). This air isn't breathable for terrestrial creatures by any means.

**Moons.** Ghelus has no moons.

**Visiting Ghelus.** Seriously not recommended.

## Observation of Moons and Other Planets
Moons and other planets have been observed using a revolutionary invention called the [[teleseer]], a large enchanted telescope which allows the operator to cast [[Scrying]] on the location it is focused on. This has allowed astronomers to see the surface of Selene and of the other planets in the Ausarian Expanse.
