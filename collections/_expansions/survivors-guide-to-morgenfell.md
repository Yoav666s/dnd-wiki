# Welcome to Morgenfell
Three kingdoms agree on one thing: magic is the ruin of society. Since the Arcane Dictum has been issued in the year 217 after the great massacre, magic and everything related to it is strictly prohibited anywhere and everywhere across the vast lands of Morgenfell. This has forced the people to adapt and find new and modern solutions to everyday problems, such as travel, communication, and monsters. They came up with wonderful railroad systems to travel over long distances, telecommunication devices to send encoded messages, and deadly firearms to protect themselves from the terrible creatures that lurk in the forest.

## A Low-Fantasy Setting
> By order of the sovereign rulers of the Three Kingdoms, and under the authority of the Arcane Dictum, the practice of magic in any and all of its forms is hereby declared strictly and absolutely forbidden. The possession, trade, or use of magical artifacts, spell scrolls, tomes, or any other enchanted instruments is likewise prohibited throughout all territories and dominions of Morgenfell, whether by land or sea.
>
> --The Arcane Dictum, 217 A.GM

As previously mentioned, magic is illegal in the realms of Morgenfell. This does not mean that it doesn't exist, but it's rare and usually practiced only in secret or in forests, where patrols are limited and few. The forests of Morgenfell are dangerous and filled with all kinds of strange creatures. Few can survive there, with or without magic, and guards only enter there when absolutely necessary. The cities themselves are well protected, but villages are exposed to terrible threats such as vampires, werewolves, and eldritch horrors.

Morgenfell is a large continent in Nornfeld, where magic is outside of the law. It is inhabited mostly by humans, but halflings, gnomes, and dwarves live amongst them, and half-orcs can be found there as well. In its dangerous forests where monstrous creatures roam free, elves have made their home. Elves, due to their magical origins, are not normally allowed within the cities and are usually arrested on sight. Since most citizens and guards don't dare go into the forests, they can reside there without being disturbed, although the presence of monsters does pose a challenge of survival.

## The Three Kingdoms
Morgenfell is divided into three kingdoms: Auberfield, Keltain, and Wedland. The Three Kingdoms are currently in peaceful, prosperous times. They thrive on trade with other continents that don't have their advanced technology, but there is tension.

### Auberfield

## What's in This Book?
Chapter 1 will introduce you to the main components of this setting, everything you need to know in order to create a campaign in Morgenfell.

Chapter 2 will dive into the political figures of each kingdom and how they interact with each other.

Chapter 3 will show you around the cities of Morgenfell, going into the details of each and every city.

Chapter 4 will introduce new work in progress subclasses, completely untested and definitely not ready for serious play.

Chapter 5 will go over new flavorful feats that fit the setting, again, completely untested.

Chapter 6 will include items, wondrous or otherwise, that are an essential part of the setting.

Chapters 7 through 9 will include adventures to kick off your campaign. Again, completely untested.

## Wonder, Horror, and Industrial Revelation
You're the one who ultimately decides how horrifying or wondrous you want your campaign to be, and that choice will probably shape the decision of *where* you want your campaign to be. Vampires can attack a village in Auberfield and fey creatures can be found in the forests of Keltain, while shapeshifting fiends and devils are by no means limited to Wedland, but each kingdom has its own unique aesthetic.

### Forests of Madness
The fey are known for their strange ways of driving mortals to insanity. You could play this up, turning an otherwise captivating setting to a terrifying one. Either way, Auberfield is known for the fey presence in its forests, where many elves make their home as well.

### Survival and Grit
In a village where eldritch horrors could show up at any time, a gun is man's best friend. Keltain is the perfect setting for your dark horror campaign. From vast crop fields and armed farmers to well guarded vampire castles, you can find it all right here.

### The Industrial Revolution
Top hats, walking canes, and elegant suits. Factories and railroads, advanced sewer systems, and everything modern (relatively, at least). Wedland is the prime, living and breathing example of the industrial revolution. The shrinking forests pose little threat, but not all danger is obsolete when shapeshifting devils slowly and insidiously infiltrate society's higher classes.

## Dwarven Technology
The the industrial advancements of Morgenfell are based on technology developed by dawrven engineers. They've invented firearms which help defend citizens from the horrors of the forests, the steam engine which powers trains and carriages, and the electric telecommunicator which allows the transmission of coded messages.

### Firearms
The invention of firearms was a revolutionary milestone in the history of Wedland, and one of the crucial steps leading to the implementation of the Arcane Dictum. Firearms are now commonplace in villages and cities, but owning and using them is regulated by the requirement of an official lisence.

#### Firearm Lisence
To get a lisence for owning and using a firearm, a citizen must file an official request to the department of safety, after which they'll be summoned for an interview to assess the necessity of such a lisence and suitability of the citizen to own a firearm. Soldiers and guards get a similar lisence at the end of their training. A firearm carrier must have a lisence on their person at all times in case of an inspection.

### The Steam Engine
Yet another revolutionary invention that allowed the Arcane Dictum to become a reality, the steam engine allows for expediency in transportation without relying on magic. The steam powered train and the steam carriage allow for travel both inside and outside of the city, respectively.

#### The Steam Powered Train
All over Morgenfell, railroad systems have been installed to allow for faster travel between cities and kingdoms. The fee is sometimes costly, but this is the quickest and safest way to travel as of yet.

#### The Steam Carriage
In large cities, travel by foot can sometimes take well over half a day. With a steam carriage it takes a fraction of the time. Fuel, however, is not inexpensive and the burning of coal contaminates the air. For this reason, it is very unpleasant to walk through the main street and it may be advised to take a different route, albeit a longer one, to avoid the smoke. Steam carriages are not common, and usually reserved for the upper class.

### Electricity
A relatively new discovery and still in its experimental phase, electricity has yet to reach the public. However, some technologies are already being used in practice.

#### The Telecommunicator
A major scientific breakthrough, the telecommunicator allows for sending coded messages over long distances where a wire system has been installed. It can transmit in two distinct pitches, high and low, in different combinations which are then decoded into letters. Timing is crucial, as a half-second to one-second delay means a space. There are professional transmitters/decoders who know all the letters by heart and can reliably transmit messages with minimal errors.

## Medicine
The study of medicine was a crucial part in the implementation of the Arcane Dictum, since magical healing was superior to any other alternative. Studying the humanoid body, the physicians of Morgenfell, and Auberfield in particular, have made significant advancements in the subject and proved that magic is not the only way to tend to wounds and sicknesses.

### Rubbing Alcohol
It has been discovered that sanitizing wounds can help prevent inflammation. By fermenting grains and distilling the product, the apothecary creates an undrinkable substance that can help sanitize wounds. This substance is called rubbing alcohol and is present in all modern healer's kits.

# Chapter 1: History of Morgenfell
> "And that which we call the 'Great Massacre' has proven to us the dangerous and reckless nature of magic. Over two hundred years it took us to restore and even surpass our previous greatness which has been sullied and destroyed by magic. To that we say: never again!"
>
> --from the Official Decree of the Arcane Dictum, 217 A.GM

## The Great Massacre
In the year 3 B.C an infamous gnome wizard in Wedland who went by the name Gregorous Victus was unceasingly studying other planes of existence. He was trying to establish a steady form of communication with beings of other planes, among them a devil from the Nine Hells. The devil seemed to be fascinated with Victus's work, and said he was always curious about the Feywild. Victus was studying a spell that would allow him to travel to another plane of existence, and he offered the devil to bring him there. The devil happily agreed and said some of his friends are also fascinated with Victus's work and want to meet him, if he could open a portal to his plane so they could travel together to the Feywild. And so he did.

When the portal opened, an army of devils and imps rushed through, and proceeded to kill Victus and anyone who stood in their path. The devil army was defeated, but at the cost of many innocent lives all over Morgenfell. This terrible incident has been since referred to as the Great Massacre, and it has led the rulers to eventually ban anything and everything that has to do with magic altogether, under the authority of the Arcane Dictum.

## The Arcane Dictum
The Arcane Dictum is the decree that effectively forbids the use and study of magic and magical items. It has been ruled in the year 217 A.GM (After the Great Massacre) in order to prevent another incident such as the Great Massacre and avoid unnecessary deaths.

It took 217 years to fully implement the Arcane Dictum because it would've been unwise to do so with the technological state at the time of the Great Massacre, when magic was still an integral part of the kingdoms' defenses, long distance travel, and communication.

During the time that took to implement the Arcane Dictum, magic was still being used but it was socially frowned upon, as society attempted to transition to a lifestyle that relies on magic less and less, if at all. Avoiding the use of magic in everyday life was encouraged even though magic was still fully legal at that period. People would take a carriage rather than rely on teleportation circles despite the distance of their destination from their starting point; .

# Chapter 4: Subclasses
With magic being illegal under the authority of the Arcane Dictum, the people of Morgenfell have adapted to the hardships of living amongst the fey, vampires, werewolves, and eldritch horrors. Developing new and unique ways to deal with these challenges, they came up with solutions such as the Medic subclass to make up for the lack of healing and the Triggerman subclass for professional use of firearms.

# Chapter 5: Feats
The people of Morgenfell have adapted to a different way of living than the rest of Nornfeld, what with their technology and lack of magic. To reflect that there are feats that compliment the setting.
