## Rock Hollow
Deep underground, there’s a vast network of caverns and tunnels, leading anywhere and everywhere around Durn. It is believed to be alive, shifting and changing without pattern. Creatures from the surface who accidentally find an entrance are rarely seen again. It is said that the caverns play tricks on your mind, beguiling you with illusions of your worst fears and deepest desires.
This network is commonly referred to as Rock Hollow, the Hollow, or, simply, the caverns.

Subterranean creatures, as well as devotees of the [Thing](#thing-of-the-hollow), can navigate through the caverns under the [Thing's blessing](#things-blessing).

Its inhabitants include colonies of drow elves, kobolds, and other creatures of the [Underdark](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Underdark) and they speak Undercommon.

### The Hollow Heart
There is believed to be a beating heart somewhere within the caverns, which keeps the Hollow alive. It is stationary, but the caverns continually shift around it, diverting away anyone who might come near it. It is said that the closer you get to the heart of the caverns, the more convoluted and confusing the tunnels become, leading you around in circles and playing tricks on you.


# Mythical Creatures
The continent of Durn is full of mythical creatures that reside in certain areas. Their eternal souls are their source of life, but they can be defeated. When a mythical creature is defeated, it leaves behind an [emblem](#mythical-emblems) that encapsulates its soul until it is risen again. While in that state, it’s possible to use this emblem as a source of magic (relating to the creature’s powers and abilities). This keeps the creature at bay, preventing it from returning to its true form. That also means that if the emblem is not in steady use, the creature might rise again, and the keeper of the emblem won’t be able to use its magic until the creature is defeated once more.
Some (but not all) mythical creatures may be intelligent and capable of speech.

## Elmersodus, the Weathered Sentinel

Also referred to as The Weathered Sentinel, Elmersodus is a powerful dragon that inhabits the land and skies. His powers affect the night sky, painting them as he sees fit. At night, he can also control the weather, the behavior of clouds and the intensity of starlight. He can see anything that’s touched by moonlight, and hear any sound the wind carries to him.
Unlike other dragons he doesn’t breath fire or spit acid. He controls the howling wind. His eyes look like moonstone, and his hard skin is a mix of dark blue and purple. His scales shine like silver in certain angles.

## Thing of the Hollow

Thing of the Hollow is a mythical creature that doesn’t speak any language, and it is believed to be itself [Rock Hollow](#rock-hollow). As patron of the underground, it guides its inhabitants and followers through the caverns and allows them safe passage. Trespassers and invaders are led astray until they lose their way. Some eventually manage to escape, but very often too late, as they have already been driven to insanity.

The Thing doesn’t have a consistent form, it shifts and changes its shape. It's made out of flesh, covered and infused with dirt, stone, minerals, and other things found in the Hollow. Therefore, it can appear anywhere within the caverns, and embody its "consciousness" in more than one place at once. However, its [heart](#the-hollow-heart) doesn't move, and is located somewhere within the caverns. Only there it can be killed, leaving behind its [locket](#the-locket).

### Thing's Blessing
Those under the Thing's blessing are allowed safe passage through the Hollow.


# Mythical Emblems
When a [mythical creature](#mythical-creatures) is defeated it leaves behind a powerful emblem of some kind, which grants its holder access to this creature's mythical powers. Unless the emblem is in steady use, the creature will eventually rise again.

## The locket
Locket of the [Thing](#thing-of-the-hollow).
