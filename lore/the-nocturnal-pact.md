# Elmersodus, the Nocturnal Sentinel

![elmersodus](../images/elmersodus.jpg)

Also referred to as simply the Sentinel, Elmersodus is a powerful dragon that inhabits the land and skies. He is a [mythical creature](mythical-creatures.md#mythical-creatures) whose powers affect the night sky, painting them as he sees fit. At night, he can also control the weather, the behavior of clouds and the intensity of starlight. He can see anything that’s touched by moonlight, and hear any sound the wind carries to him.
Unlike other dragons he doesn’t breath fire or spit acid. He controls the howling wind. His eyes look like moonstone, and his hard skin is a mix of dark blue and purple. His scales shine like silver in certain angles.
