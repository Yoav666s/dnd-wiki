The alignment chart is fairly limited. Why can't a character be Chaotic but still abide by law? Why limit roleplaying to Good, Neutral, and Evil? How do you cover moral grey areas?

This is where the Alignment Chart Expansion comes into play. Designed to represent the full spectrum of personality traits, it covers every basic roleplaying aspect you need to know about a character. This isn't just a guide to enhance roleplaying, but a tool for creating lively and convincing NPCs, as well.

# The Five Traits
Altruism, Courage, Sociability, Morality, and Entropy. Each trait represents an independent roleplaying aspect of the game with a value that ranges from -3 to 3. The following charts contain guideline descriptions for each unique value. The traits follow a bell curve: -3/3 are edge cases, -2/2 resemble uncommon personality traits, and -1/1 are within normal deviation, while 0 is the average.

## Altruism
How much your character is willing to go out of their way to help someone.

| 2 | **Kind.** Would go to great lengths in order to help someone in need. |
| 1 | **Neighborly.** Happy to help as long as it doesn't come at their own expense. |
| 0 | **Collaborative.** Willing help, but won't go out of their way to do so. |

# Designing Your Character
To determine your character's personality traits, you first generate five numbers and then assign them to your five traits.

## Generate Your Values
Determine your traits by using one of the following methods. 

**Standard Array.** Choose one standard array from the following:

| Standard Array ||||||
| :--- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Default |  2  |  1  |  1  |  0   |  -1  |
| Tainted |  1  |  0   |  -1  |  -1  |  -2  |
| Fervid | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | -1 |
| Precarious | 1 | 0 | 0 | -1 | -3 |

**Random Generation.** Roll two d4s and subtract the second value from the first. Do this four more times, so you have five numbers.

**Classic Alignment Chart Conversion.** Consult the conversion table:

| Alignment | Altruism | Courage | Sociability | Morality | Entropy |
| :--- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Lawful Good | 2 | 0 | -1 | 1 | 1 |
| Neutral Good | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Chaotic Good | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | -2 |
| Lawful Neutral | 0 | 1 | -1 | 1 | 2 |
| True Neutral | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Chaotic Neutral | 0 | 1 | 0 | -1 | -2 |
| Lawful Evil | -2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| Neutral Evil | -2 | 1 | 0 | -2 | 0 |
| Chaotic Evil | -3 | 1 | 0 | -1 | -2 |

## Assign Trait Values
Once you've generated five traits, assign them to Altruism, Courage, Sociability, Morality, and Entropy. Keep in mind your class and ability scores.

If you're using the standard array option, you may consult the Background Archetype Table (or BAT).

| Background | Altruism | Courage | Sociability | Morality | Entropy |
| :--- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Acolyte | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | -1 |
| Artisan | 1 | 0 | -1 | 1 | 2 |
| Charlatan | -1 | 0 | 1 | -2 | -1 |
| Criminal | -1 | 1 | -1 | -2 | 0 |
| Entertainer | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 | -1 |
| Farmer | 1 | -1 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| Soldier | 0 | 1 | -1 | 1 | 2 |
