The alignment chart is fairly limited. Why can't a character be Chaotic but still abide by law? Why limit roleplaying to Good, Neutral, and Evil? How do you cover moral grey areas?

This is where the Alignment Chart Expansion comes into play. Designed to represent the full spectrum of personality traits, it covers every basic roleplaying aspect you need to know about a character. Each trait value ranges from -3 to 3. You can determine the value of a trait by rolling 2d4 and subtracting between them, resulting in a number between -3 and 3.

# The Five Traits
Each trait represents an independent roleplaying aspect of the game.

## Altruism
How much your character is willing to go out of their way to help someone.
