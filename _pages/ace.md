The alignment chart is fairly limited. Why can't a character be Chaotic but still abide by law? Why limit roleplaying to Good, Neutral, and Evil? How do you cover moral grey areas?

This is where the Alignment Chart Expansion comes into play. Designed to represent the full spectrum of personality traits, it covers every basic roleplaying aspect you need to know about a character. Each trait value ranges from -3 to 3.
